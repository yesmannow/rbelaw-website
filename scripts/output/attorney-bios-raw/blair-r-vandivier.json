In addition to operating these businesses, Blair serves as outside counsel to a number of similarly sized entities. Blair brings a unique perspective to the role of the lawyer as a result of spending a significant amount of his time in the shoes of the business owner and manager.\n\nBlair provides general business counsel to his clients in the manufacturing, service, and construction industries on such issues as the choice and formation of the entity, relationships of the equity owners, financing the growth and maintenance of the enterprise, acquisition and divestiture, real estate sales and leasing, as well as numerous related matters.\n\n## Representative Matters\n\n- Assisted numerous secured lenders in the negotiation and closing of commercial lending transactions involving manufacturing, construction, commercial leasing and real estate matters.\n- Assisted buyers and sellers of businesses in the manufacturing and services industries in the successful completion of transactions involving the transfer of ownership.\n- Provided counsel on an ongoing basis to business managers and owners in the challenges associated with the day-to-day operation of their businesses.\n\n## Publications & Presentations\n\n###### Publications\n\n**The Basics of Non-Disclosure Agreements in Commercial Transactions**\n\n- In its simplest form, “Confidential Information” is information considered “secret” and it is perceived that keeping it “secret” provides some advantage. The value of the secret is not relevant. In order to maintain the confidentiality and therefore the value of the information, disclosure of the confidential information should only be made to persons who are subject to obligations of confidentiality. Once “secret” information is shared with someone who does not have any obligation to protect its confidentiality, it is no longer secret. It is axiomatic that once released, the genie cannot be put back into the bottle. Accordingly, there are times when it is necessary to share confidential information with outsiders and protect the confidentiality of the information. The rules for sharing this information should be contained in a document that is usually referred to as a Confidentiality or Non-Disclosure Agreement (the “NDA”).\n\n## Awards & Recognition\n\n- Martindale-Hubbell AV rated\n- Recipient, American Jurisprudence Award in Estates\n- Listed in Who’s Who in American Law\n\n## Community Activity\n\n- BMW Golf Championship, Crooked Stick Golf Club, Access Control Committee Chair, 2012\n- United States Senior Open Championship, Crooked Stick Golf Club, Access Control Committee Chair. 2009\n- House Committee, Crooked Stick Golf Club\n- Butler University Basketball\n  - Organizing Committee Tip Off Dinner, 2009 – 2012\n- Butler University Central Indiana Alumni Association\n  - President, 2010 – 2012\n\n#### Associations\n\n- Indiana State Bar Association\n\n#### Bar and Court Admissions\n\n- Indiana, 1978\n- U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, 1978\n\n#### Education\n\nIndiana University Maurer School of Law, JD, _cum laude,_ 1981\n\nButler University, BS, Administration and Economics (Dual Major) with _Highest Honors_ in Economics, _Magna Cum Laude_, 1978\n\n### Industries Served\n\nFinance\n\nManufacturing\n\n### Practice Areas\n\nBusiness Contract Drafting & Negotiation\n\nBusiness Entity Selection & Formation\n\nBusiness Mergers & Acquisitions\n\n╳\n\n![](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/blair-r-vandivier/)",
