The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant providers. The Court of Appeals affirmed and held that it was not necessary to name residents or students individually on the consent form, as the form’s generic reference to “residents” and “students” sufficed. _Tipton v. Isaacs_, 17 N.E.3d 292 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014), _trans denied_, 24 N.E.3d 967 (Ind. 2015).\n- Represented landowner alleged to have breached duty to invitee to prevent criminal acts of third parties, in which Indiana Supreme Court affirmed grant of summary judgment in favor of landowner, on the grounds landowner did not breach duty to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable criminal acts against invitees: _L.W. v. Western Golf Ass’n._, 712 N.E.2d 983 (Ind. 1999)\n- Has successfully defended health-care providers in medical malpractice actions before the Indiana Department of Insurance and in courts throughout the State of Indiana.\n\n# Publications\n\n[![23 RBE Attorneys Selected to 2026 Best Lawyers](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blog-Header-2026-Best-Lawyers-1-400x250.png)](https://rbelaw.com/2026-best-lawyers/)\n\n## [23 RBE Attorneys Selected to 2026 Best Lawyers](https://rbelaw.com/2026-best-lawyers/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Aug 21, 2025\n\nRiley Bennett Egloff Announces 2026 Best Lawyers Honorees  23 RBE Attorneys Recognized by Best Lawyers in America...\n\n[![Riley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Super-Lawyers-2025-400x250.jpg)](https://rbelaw.com/2025-super-lawyers-honorees/)\n\n## [Riley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees](https://rbelaw.com/2025-super-lawyers-honorees/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Feb 19, 2025\n\nRiley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees 17 RBE Attorneys Recognized by Indiana Super Lawyers —...\n\n[![Laura Binford Named DTCI Defense Lawyer of the Year](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Laura-Binford-and-Don-Smith-Laura-DTCI-Defense-Lawyer-of-the-Year-Cropped-400x250.jpg)](https://rbelaw.com/laura-binford-named-dtci-defense-lawyer-of-the-year/)\n\n## [Laura Binford Named DTCI Defense Lawyer of the Year](https://rbelaw.com/laura-binford-named-dtci-defense-lawyer-of-the-year/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Nov 22, 2024\n\nLaura Binford Named DTCI Defense Lawyer of the Year Laura K.
