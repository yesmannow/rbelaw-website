Along the way, he discovered that he has an insatiable curiosity for learning about the nuances and practical realities of every facet of the law, which informs both the scope and manner of his professional practice. As a motivated problem solver and life-long learner, Patrick represents and advises a variety of clients in diverse substantive areas, including both litigation matters and business transactions.\n\nIn his litigation practice, Patrick represents clients in state and federal courts across Indiana. He has represented businesses, individuals, insurance companies, and government entities in matters such as contract disputes, insurance coverage disputes, real property disputes, breach of fiduciary duty claims, labor trafficking claims, Title IX claims, and attorney malpractice claims and/or responses to disciplinary grievances.  Patrick has also litigated appeals before both the Indiana Court of Appeals and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIn addition to his robust litigation practice, Patrick also assists businesses, business owners, and financial institutions with loan transactions, real property transactions, mergers and acquisitions, general contractual matters, and general governance matters. Patrick has assisted his clients with transactions both big and small—from five figures to nine figures. Beyond his work for business and other commercial entities, Patrick has also assisted Indiana political subdivisions with a variety of municipal law issues, including by drafting legal opinions for elected officials and drafting ordinances.\n\nWhile attending the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, Patrick served as an Articles Editor for the _Indiana Law Review_ and his Note on crowdfunding rules was selected for publication. Patrick also assisted first-year law students with legal writing by serving as a Dean’s Tutorial Society Fellow. Patrick was named to the Order of Barristers in the Moot Court Program and was also a Semi-Finalist in the 2017 Honorable Robert H. Staton Moot Court Competition. In addition, Patrick completed a legal externship with Cummins Inc. where he gained experience in cross-border transactions and intellectual property, including trademarks and trade secrets. Concurrently with his final two years of law school, Patrick completed his M.B.A. from Purdue University’s Krannert School of Management.\n\nPrior to completing law school, Patrick worked for many years in the performing arts and as a manufacturer’s representative for architectural and entertainment lighting products.\n\nWhen he is not at work, Patrick enjoys cooking (especially barbecue), spending time with his wife and daughter, and attending performing arts and sporting events.\n\n_Stringer v. Hammond-Whiting Care Ctr._, No., 2025 LX 420801 (Ind. Ct. App. 2025).\n\n- Successfully obtained a dismissal for a long-term care facility based on a violation of the statute of limitations for a non-qualified health care provider subject to the Professional Services Statute.\n\n# Publications\n\n[![23 RBE Attorneys Selected to 2026 Best Lawyers](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blog-Header-2026-Best-Lawyers-1-400x250.png)](https://rbelaw.com/2026-best-lawyers/)\n\n## [23 RBE Attorneys Selected to 2026 Best Lawyers](https://rbelaw.com/2026-best-lawyers/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Aug 21, 2025\n\nRiley Bennett Egloff Announces 2026 Best Lawyers Honorees  23 RBE Attorneys Recognized by Best Lawyers in America...\n\n[![Riley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Super-Lawyers-2025-400x250.jpg)](https://rbelaw.com/2025-super-lawyers-honorees/)\n\n## [Riley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees](https://rbelaw.com/2025-super-lawyers-honorees/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Feb 19, 2025\n\nRiley Bennett Egloff Announces 2025 Super Lawyers Honorees 17 RBE Attorneys Recognized by Indiana Super Lawyers —...\n\n[![7 Questions to Ask before Appealing a Court Order](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/JOS-Article-Header-Email-400x250.jpg)](https://rbelaw.com/7-questions-to-ask-before-appealing/)\n\n## [7 Questions to Ask before Appealing a Court Order](https://rbelaw.com/7-questions-to-ask-before-appealing/)\n\nby [Patrick McCarney](https://rbelaw.com/author/patrick-s-mccarney/ \"Posts by Patrick McCarney\") \\| Feb 11, 2025\n\nIf you are a party to a lawsuit, there is an inescapable risk that you might lose — whether on a specific issue or...\n\n[![Best Lawyers Recognizes 22 RBE Attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Best-Lawyers-2025-22-attorneys-400x250.png)](https://rbelaw.com/best-lawyers-recognizes-22-rbe-attorneys/)\n\n## [Best Lawyers Recognizes 22 RBE Attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/best-lawyers-recognizes-22-rbe-attorneys/)\n\nby [Anne Marie Farrow](https://rbelaw.com/author/afarrow/ \"Posts by Anne Marie Farrow\") \\| Aug 15, 2024\n\n22 RBE Attorneys Recognized as Best Lawyers in America Riley Bennett Egloff LLP (RBE) is pleased to announce that 22...\n\n[![New FTC Noncompete Rule May Change the Employment Landscape](https://rbelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/architecture-22039_1920-400x250.jpg)](https://rbelaw.com/new-ftc-noncompete-rule-may-change-the-employment-landscape/)\n\n## [New FTC Noncompete Rule May Change the Employment Landscape](https://rbelaw.com/new-ftc-noncompete-rule-may-change-the-employment-landscape/)\n\nby [Patrick McCarney](https://rbelaw.com/author/patrick-s-mccarney/ \"Posts by Patrick McCarney\") \\| Apr 25, 2024\n\nBy: Patrick S.
