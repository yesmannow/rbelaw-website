McKinney, Sarah Evans Barker, and Tanya Walton Pratt. Through this experience, Jaclyn gained unique litigation experience and insight into the judicial process.\n\n### Intellectual Property, Sports & Entertainment Law\n\nJaclyn is well respected for her intellectual property practice, in which she provides legal counsel on trademark, copyright, right of publicity, trade dress, and trade secret matters, including registration and prosecution, licensing, and litigation. As part of her sports and entertainment and intellectual property practice, Jaclyn, an avid sports fan, has done substantial work in the emerging area of name, image, and likeness (NIL) in collegiate athletics.\n\nJaclyn provides pro-bono legal counsel to the Boilermaker Alliance (a non-profit NIL collective for Purdue University student athletes) and serves as legal counsel to multiple businesses in their efforts to engage collegiate athletes in promotional and marketing activities. She also assisted in the development of terms of use for the development of software technology serving as a portal for collegiate athletes to engage in NIL opportunities. Prior to joining RBE, Jaclyn worked as a legal extern for the NCAA Enforcement Department and for the former Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Athletics Department.\n\n### Indiana State Bar Association & IndyBar\n\nA graduate of the ISBA Leadership Development Academy Class 11, Jaclyn is committed to several professional organizations at board and committee level roles in the Indianapolis area. She serves on the executive committees for the Indianapolis Bar Association’s Intellectual Property section as Chair-Elect and as a former Chair for the Sports and Entertainment section.\n\nJaclyn has also worked extensively on the development, revitalization, and growth of The Racing Attorneys Conference (TRAC), a traveling conference to promote the education and camaraderie of attorneys in the motor sports industry from across the United States.\n\n### Education\n\nJaclyn attended the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, where she graduated _summa cum laude_ and served as an Executive Articles Editor for the _Indiana Law Review._ Jaclyn also acted as the President of the Indiana University McKinney Sports and Entertainment Law Society as a Dean’s Tutorial Society Fellow, providing guidance and tutoring services to first-year law students. During her time in law school, Jaclyn also worked as a research assistant to multiple professors, including those with a focus on intellectual property matters.\n\n# Publications\n\n[![Riley Bennett
