# INSURANCE

Our attorneys provide an array of services to the insurance industry.

## Insurance Defense

Our attorneys provide legal services to insurance carriers including the defense of claims in the areas of:

- products liability
- environmental and toxic substance law
- officers’ and directors’ liability
- worker’s compensation claims; and
- general personal injury and property damage claims, including claims arising out of catastrophic construction site accidents

Our attorneys also defend professional negligence and malpractice claims asserted against accountants, attorneys, insurance agents, real estate brokers, physicians, dentists, hospitals and other service providers.

## Insurance Coverage

The expectations of policyholders do not always match the language of their insurance policies. When coverage disputes arise, insurance companies look to our attorneys for assistance in determining the extent of coverage described by an insurance policy under the specific facts presented. We work with both primary and excess insurance carriers to evaluate coverage, and to represent them in court actions where the court is asked to declare who is covered under a policy and/or the extent of the coverage provided.

We have assisted insurance companies in hundreds of insurance coverage disputes of all shapes and sizes, ranging from disputes about who is an insured under an automobile liability policy for a limited dollar claim, up to an environmental insurance coverage action involving hundreds of millions of dollars.

## Insurance Regulation

Our attorneys advise clients in virtually every segment of the insurance industry, providing guidance and advice to navigate compliance with Indiana insurance statues, regulations, rules, and bulletins.  While first seeking resolution of disputes regarding regulatory compliance, we are also experienced in proactively representing clients in regulatory hearings and litigation in state and federal courts. Our clients include companies in the areas of property and casualty, life and health, managed care, reinsurance, insurance holding companies, risk retention groups, mutual companies, insurance agencies and brokerages, third party administrators, regulatory agencies, risk managers and trade groups.

In addition to regulatory compliance issues, our focus is always on identifying practical solutions to the challenges our insurance clients face in today’s complex marketplace regarding mergers and acquisitions, asset transfer transactions, intervention in various enforcement actions, reinsurance, and insolvency counseling.
