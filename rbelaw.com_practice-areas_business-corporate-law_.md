## BUSINESS & CORPORATE LAW

The business law attorneys of Riley Bennett Egloff offer a comprehensive range of legal services for their business clients, from formation to dissolution, handling all of the various legal issues that a business can face.

## Business Entity Selection & Formation

There are many important decisions to be made by an emerging business, each of which comes with potential pitfalls that can be damaging to the business and its owners in the absence of proper legal guidance. Our business law attorneys can help you with these issues, steering you clear of the problems while helping you select the type of entity which best serves your business interests and goals. From drafting the formation documents to stock issuance to agreements between co-owners, our Firm’s business attorneys can help you establish a solid legal foundation for your business future.

## Business Contract Review, Drafting & Negotiation

Beyond the formation of business entities, Riley Bennett Egloff acts as corporate counsel for many of its business clients, including the negotiation, drafting and review of our clients’ contracts, ranging in size from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars. With just a few hours’ time, our review of contracts before they are signed can help our clients avoid paying for hundreds of hours of attorney time in litigation once a contract dispute arises.

## Business Consultation & Advice

Running a business is hard work. Our business attorneys help you lay the solid foundation so that it runs more smoothly – best practices for your contracts, business communications, employment relations, intellectual property and trade secret protective measures, insurance coverage, and litigation avoidance to name a few. Let our legal team help you so that you have the confidence to get business done the right way.

## Business Succession Planning

At some point, all business owners leave their businesses. In addition to enjoying peace of mind, business owners who have planned for their departures stand to profit much more than those owners who have not.

Good succession planning involves legal, accounting, tax, and operational considerations. Our attorneys can identify the important legal considerations and provide you with advice and counsel to allow you to achieve both your business and personal objectives.

## Business Dispute Resolution

Inevitably, businesses need help resolving disputes that arise internally (among shareholders, members, or employment issues) or externally with vendors, landlords, customers, or competitors.  Riley Bennett Egloff’s business litigators are experienced in helping to resolve disputes without litigation whenever possible, and pursuing or defending claims in litigation. Often, our attorneys work “behind the scenes” to make sure our clients are in the best position to prevail should litigation ensue – and you can rest assured that we’ll be honest with you if you need to employ other measures to avoid liability. Here, litigation attorneys are your allies who provide protection to your company’s interests well before you come near a courtroom, working hard to meet your goals as efficiently as expeditiously as possible.
