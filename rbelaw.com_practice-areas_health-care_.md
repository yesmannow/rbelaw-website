## HEALTH CARE LAW

[Riley Bennett Egloff](https://rbelaw.com/practice-areas/health-care/rbelaw.com) proudly counts among its [clients](https://rbelaw.com/clients/) many major metropolitan hospitals, critical access hospitals, immediate care centers, and nursing homes, as well as individual health care providers including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and dentists. The Firm also represents professional liability insurance carriers and risk retention groups.

Because the Firm’s practice areas cover a wide range of [services](https://rbelaw.com/practice-areas/), it is able to offer advice regarding the legal concerns of the medical industry, including medical malpractice defense; professional licensure defense; entity formation, governance, and business strategy; employment-related issues; real estate issues; non-compete matters; contract negotiation, drafting and enforcement; general business litigation; billing and collection matters; and general liability matters. We also counsel and advocate regarding health care statutes and regulations including compliance with Stark laws.

### Health Care Regulation & Administration

### Medical Malpractice Defense

Our health care law [attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/) have defended physicians, nurses, paramedics, dentists, hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, immediate care facilities, and other health care providers in medical malpractice actions for over thirty years.

Along with this insight, our Firm combines a work ethic and diligence that leaves no stone unturned in its defense of cases.

In addition to [attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/) who have devoted their practices to the defense of medical professionals, we also have on staff experienced medical professionals who assist our attorneys in navigating the medical complexities of any particular case.

While our [Firm](https://rbelaw.com/about-us/) is always prepared to defend our [health care clients](https://rbelaw.com/clients/#healthcare), we realize that it is in our clients’ best interest to avoid a medical malpractice action when possible. Thus, our Firm also assists our health care clients in many different areas of their practice, including prevention of litigation through early resolution and risk management issues. Lawyers in the firm speak and provide presentations in these and other areas to our health care clients on a frequent basis.
