## GOVERNMENT LAW

Our attorneys have substantial experience representing state and local governments in a wide variety of matters.

The attorneys at Riley Bennett Egloff LLP have represented Indiana municipalities of all sizes (including the City of Indianapolis), as well as other political subdivisions and Indiana state agencies and educational service centers.  We frequently represent companies and individuals before federal, state, and local government agencies in regulatory matters ranging from workplace health and safety issues to actions against professional licenses to civil rights actions against employers and property owners.

Our experience includes representing municipalities in litigation involving abandoned housing, eminent domain, public nuisance issues and landlord-tenant disputes; assisting the Indiana Department of Insurance with market conduct exams; negotiating government contracts; and proposing changes to state statutes and local ordinances. In particular, our attorneys are regularly asked to testify before Committees of the Indiana General Assembly as subject matter experts on insurance and construction matters.

Our attorneys have served as Chair of the Indiana Election Commission for three Indiana Governors; as an Administrative Law Judge for the Securities Division of the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, and as counsel to a prominent Central Indiana City’s Council.
