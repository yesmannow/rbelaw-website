## REAL ESTATE, LAND USE & ZONING

Our attorneys handle a wide range of real estate transactions, including commercial and residential real estate acquisitions and sales, commercial leasing, mortgage loans and other real estate financing.

The Firm’s real estate, land use, and zoning clients are quite diverse and include developers, builders, banks and other mortgage lenders, governmental authorities, and individual sellers and purchasers of commercial and residential property.

We also represent clients in litigation and administrative proceedings arising out of real estate related transactions, including matters such as litigation involving zoning, land use planning, environmental matters, eminent domain, foreclosure and real estate taxation.

## Land Use & Planning

We have handled all types of development and redevelopment, including residential and mixed use projects, office parks, distribution centers, health care facilities, shopping centers, and industrial facilities. Our services enable our clients to take a project from conception through the full approval process, up to and including the building permits. Our experience includes obtaining rezoning and master plan changes and zoning and land use approvals, including local and county application, land use counseling, and zoning litigation.

## Commercial Real Estate & Leasing

The experienced and knowledgeable real estate attorneys and staff are available to guide you through all aspects of acquisitions, approval, financing (including construction and permanent financing) and compliance with governmental regulations.

In particular, our attorneys have substantial experience negotiating commercial leases on behalf of tenants ranging in size from small, family-owned businesses to multi-national corporations. Commercial tenants often fail to negotiate their leases with their landlords, based on the mistaken belief that they have no choice but to sign the leases as presented by their landlords. While it is true that landlords have significant leverage in negotiations, there are important provisions in each commercial lease that can and should be negotiated, which can save tenants time, trouble, and money in the future.

## Residential Real Estate

Home ownership is the major financial transaction for most people. It is also a setting in which disputes occasionally arise, typically in construction. With experience representing builders and homeowners, our attorneys are ideally positioned to handle all kinds of disputes arising out of residential real estate and construction.
