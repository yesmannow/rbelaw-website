## LABOR & EMPLOYMENT LAW

Acting exclusively on behalf of management, our attorneys provide representation in virtually every aspect of employer-employee relations.

## Labor Law

Our labor & employment attorneys assist employers in all industries with a full range of traditional labor law issues, such as:

- Wage and hour issues and investigations

- [Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) compliance and litigation

- Union avoidance and labor relations strategy

- National Labor Relations Board practice

- Collective bargaining

- Arbitrations of labor disputes

- Day-to-day employment decisions

- [IOSHA](https://www.in.gov/dol/iosha.htm) investigations

- Employee relations audits and assessments

## Employment Law

Our labor & employment attorneys represent employers in a wide variety of employment law matters, including:

- Defending discrimination claims (race, sex, age, disability, handicap, religion, and similar protected categories)

- Negotiating and drafting employment agreements

- Drafting, defending and prosecuting non-competition agreements, no-solicitation agreements, trade secret agreements, and non-piracy provisions

- Defending wrongful termination claims

- Drafting employee handbooks, employment policies, and work rules

- Defending [Family and Medical Leave Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) claims

- Defending unemployment compensation claims

- Defending claims of ERISA violations, as well as violations of employee benefit plans and executive compensation plans


## Non-Competition Agreements

A non-competition agreement can be a valuable tool to protect a business interest, whether you are protecting an existing business or buying one. [Non-competition clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause) are commonly included in employment contracts, sale agreements and shareholder agreements. A well-drafted non-competition agreement may mean the difference between the success or failure of a [business](https://rbelaw.com/practice-areas/business-corporate-law/). The difficulty with these agreements comes in their enforceability. The clauses receive additional judicial scrutiny, and there are occasions when courts will not enforce these kinds of agreements.

That is why you need experienced [attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/) to assist you in drafting and enforcing non-competition agreements. Our [attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/) have extensive experience representing employers, companies, shareholders, and individual employees in these cases.

## Worker’s Compensation Defense

Our labor & employment [attorneys](https://rbelaw.com/our-team/attorneys/) represent employers, insurers, and third party administrators in worker’s compensation matters throughout Indiana. We pride ourselves in providing our [clients](https://rbelaw.com/clients/) with an early evaluation of each case, which allows us to resolve cases efficiently and effectively, including taking cases to hearing where appropriate.
