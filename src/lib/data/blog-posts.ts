Additionally, under Indiana’s existing medical malpractice standard, several different factors are analyzed when determining whether a doctor acted reasonably in a specific set of circumstances, and appropriate use of technology is always likely to be only one of those factors.

It typically requires no formal registration beyond any necessary licenses or permits, and profits are reported directly on your personal tax return. For entrepreneurs just getting started, this option may seem attractive due to its low cost and ease of use. However, it comes with a significant tradeoff because there is no legal separation between you and your business. If the business is sued or incurs debt, your personal assets, including your home and savings, are at risk. Sole proprietors may also face difficulty raising outside funds or building business credit."

        "text": "For those who want greater protection while keeping operations relatively straightforward, forming an LLC is often the next logical option. An LLC, while not a complete shield, can offer personal liability protection, meaning your personal assets could be shielded from business debts or legal judgments arising out of the actions/inactions of others who are part of the business or its operation. At the same time, LLC’s benefit from pass-through taxation (being taxed either as an individual, a partnership, or elected S Corporation), so profits and losses flow directly to the owners’ personal tax returns without being taxed at the entity level. LLC’s are also highly flexible. They can be owned by one person or multiple members and are typically governed by an operating agreement that outlines how the business will be managed. LLC’s can be used when there is a desire to raise capital from others. An LLC offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and manageable administrative requirements, which makes it an appealing choice for startups, small businesses, and partnerships. However, it still involves some formal requirements, such as filing formation documents with the state and complying with any ongoing state obligations like annual reports or fees."

A corporation can also be a pass-through entity for tax purposes but also can be its own taxable entity with the required filing of a tax return and payment of corporate taxes from the entity when that makes business sense. In the case of C corporations, this may result in double taxation — once at the corporate level, and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders. The S Corporation election can be an alternative to allow for pass-through taxation. A corporation can also be used when there is a desire to raise capital from others. Corporations do come with stricter governance requirements, including maintaining corporate records, holding annual meetings, and observing other formalities. The liability protection of a corporation is similar to an LLC, but when the corporate formalities are followed, a corporation provides strong liability protection."

But a “loss” is not necessarily the end of the story because our system of justice gives opportunities for litigants to appeal to a higher court. Nevertheless, having the ability to appeal an adverse decision does not mean it is the best decision for you under every circumstance. Whether or not an appeal is worth it will depend on a variety of economic and non-economic factors that will be different in each case, but any litigant considering an appeal should carefully think about the following topics and discuss their impact with their attorneys:"

        "type": "list",
        "ordered": true,
        "items": [
          "What type of appeal would I take?The first thing to know is that not every issue is automatically appealable. The most common appeals generally fall into one of two categories: appeals of a final judgment (typically issued at the conclusion of a lawsuit) and appeals of interlocutory orders (orders issued before a final judgment). Appeals of interlocutory orders are further divided into appeals that can be taken as a matter of right and appeals that can be taken only if permission is granted by the trial court and the appeal is accepted by the Court of Appeals. If your issue falls into the second, discretionary category and leave is not granted, you will have to wait until after a final judgment is issued before you can appeal the issue. Varying procedural nuances for each category of appeal mean that identifying which type your issue falls into is critical to ensuring your appellate rights are preserved.",
          "What rubric will the appellate court use to determine the outcome?Courts of appeal will examine different issues through different lenses called “standards of review,” and the application of certain standards of review can dramatically affect the likelihood of prevailing. For example, in Indiana, courts of appeal will only look at a trial judge’s decision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion, which happens when a trial court’s decision is “clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court” or when a trial court misinterprets the law. This standard is very deferential to the trial court’s decision and can be difficult to overcome. However, if you were instead appealing the denial of a motion for summary judgment, the court would review the same motion and evidence as the trial court using a de novo standard, which essentially means the appellate court is giving a second opinion without any deference to the trial judge’s decision. The standard applicable to your issue may impact your chances of success and should be factored into your decision-making process.",
          "What arguments can I make on appeal?Regardless of the type of appealable issue, you will need to identify an error made by the trial court. Initiating an appeal is not an opportunity to introduce new evidence or legal theories, and an appellate court is only going to consider what was presented to the trial court. Appeals provide a chance to correct errors committed by the trial court—they are not a chance to deploy a different strategy because the original strategy was not persuasive enough. Appeals also often require litigants to pick and choose their battles. Even if there are numerous errors in your case that could be appealed, the most successful appeals only challenge a few issues because asking a court to review too many issues can distract the court from your best arguments. Moreover, if you include too many issues, you may not have enough pages in your brief to effectively argue each point.",
          "How much will it cost?Appeals can be expensive. At a minimum, any appeal will require time for performing legal research and drafting briefs to submit to the Court. Appeals may also require the compilation of a written record, the filing and briefing of motions, and the preparation for and attendance at an oral argument in front of the appellate court. The time spent on these tasks will vary considerably based on the complexity and novelty of the issues presented. Additionally, if the appeal is of a monetary judgment, the judgment remains enforceable unless the appellant stays enforcement by giving a bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other form of security approved by the trial court.But there are other costs to consider too. For example, many interlocutory issues do not dispose of the entire case, so the appealing party still must bear the remaining cost of trial court litigation after the appeal. In the most extreme case—an appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial — the appealing party, if successful, will have the burden of paying for a new trial that still might yield an adverse result.",
          "Am I prepared to extend litigation?Litigation is unpleasant and invasive. It is very easy for a litigant to become emotionally and intellectually worn down by a lawsuit. Appeals can take months or even years to play out, and in many situations, they do not fully resolve the lawsuit. Also, an appeal does not, by itself, put a hold on proceedings in the trial court. Stays may be granted under certain circumstances, but if not, you may have to fight battles in the appellate court and the trial court at the same time.",
          "Are there unique circumstances to consider?There are likely special circumstances specific to your case that could tip the scales one way or the other. An appeal could be a good approach if a final judgment was erroneously entered against you on a claim that may negatively impact your reputation or ability to conduct your business. An appeal may also be justified if an adverse decision involved an issue that is likely to come up again for you. For example, if the adverse decision involved an incorrect interpretation of a contractual provision commonly used by your business, it could be prudent to initiate an appeal to try to keep the provision enforceable and to prevent another party from deploying that interpretation against you in a subsequent dispute. Relatedly, you could be faced with uncertain, unsettled, or underdeveloped law in a particular area that may affect you in the future. In such a case, an appeal may be worth it so the law can be clarified. Besides circumstances impacting you directly, a credible appeal could also, under the right circumstances, bring an otherwise recalcitrant party to the settlement table because the party, who will need to respond to your appeal, must think about the same burdens of an appeal.",
          "What is at stake?Finally, you should carefully consider what is at stake if you do not appeal. A “loss” on a relatively minor issue should be evaluated differently than a multi-million-dollar judgment. Not every plausible error will result in a material impact on your case, but some will. A critical part of your decision-making should be weighing the cost of doing nothing against the costs and burdens of the appeal. Sometimes doing nothing is more costly than appealing; sometimes appealing is more costly than it is worth."

        "text": "For many years, collegiate athletes faced restrictions on their ability to earn compensation related to their image or athletic performance. However, recent policy changes and judicial decisions surrounding student-athlete compensation have significantly changed the landscape of collegiate athletics. Beginning in July of 2021, following the unanimous United States Supreme Court decision in NCAA v. Alston, 594 U.S. 69 (2021) (in which the Court decided that restrictions limiting collegiate athletes to be compensated only with education-based benefits violated federal anti-trust laws), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has allowed collegiate athletes to be paid for use of their names, images, and likenesses (NIL). This means that student-athletes can now earn money from endorsements, sponsorships, autograph signings, social media posts, and other activities based on their NIL."

In doing so, they are often unaware of their rights to send the project owner what is called a “personal liability notice” under Indiana Code § 32-28-3-9. The personal liability notice informs the project owner that the subcontractor has not been paid and that the project owner may not release additional payment to the general contractor for any work on the project without first retaining an amount sufficient to pay the subcontractor’s claim in full. If the project owner releases payment to the general contractor without retaining an amount sufficient to pay the subcontractor in full after receiving the notice, the project owner becomes liable to the subcontractor for the amount that the project owner should have retained from the general contractor."

In that circumstance, the project owner must hold $150,000 from the general contractor until the subcontractor has been paid (either by the project owner or the general contractor). If the project owner were to hold only $100,000 for the subcontractor and pay the remaining $100,000 to the general contractor, the project owner becomes personally liable to the subcontractor for the $50,000 that the project owner should have retained for the subcontractor but instead paid to the general contractor."

The personal liability notice is effective so long as, at the time the project owner receives the notice, the project owner is holding proceeds of the prime contract. If the project owner has paid out all prime contract proceeds prior to its receipt of a personal liability notice, the notice is not effective because the project owner has no prime contract proceeds to hold for the subcontractor’s benefit. For that reason, it behooves a subcontractor to send its personal liability notice to the project owner sooner rather than later, which increases the probability that the project owner will be holding prime contract proceeds when it receives the notice."

Instead, whether monument designs are eligible for copyright protection must be determined on a case-by-case basis. As the definition suggests, to qualify for copyright protection, a monument must be (1) a work of “authorship,” (2) fixed in a tangible medium, that is (3) “original” to the author. If any of those three (3) elements is missing, the monument is not eligible for copyright protection.",

First, the two works at issue must be substantially similar. To determine whether two works are “substantially similar,” courts will typically focus on whether an ordinary observer, who is not tasked with detecting differences, would find that the two works have the same aesthetic appeal. Where a copyrighted work incorporates elements that are within the public domain and are not original to the author of the work, the substantial similarity must be based on the original elements only. Second, the accused infringer must have had “access” to the copyrighted work. In this context, “access” means that the accused infringer had a reasonable (not simply any) possibility of being exposed to the copyrighted work.

One such defense is that the copying was part of a “fair use” of a copyrighted work (i.e., for the purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research). Another defense is based on the copyright holder’s misuse of the copyright (i.e., copyright holders applying their copyright in in a way that would strong arm commercial actors to agreeing to grant the holder a limited monopoly that is not granted by copyright law). Such defenses to a copyright infringement claim are highly fact-specific and are not applicable in all cases."

Those remedies include equitable relief (e.g., a Court Order that directs the infringer to cease its infringing activities and to dispose of the infringing articles); monetary awards; and attorney fees and costs. Monetary awards fall in two categories: (a) actual damages (i.e., the copyright holder’s actual monetary injury suffered as a result of the infringement, plus any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement that are not taken into account in computing the holder’s actual monetary injury); or (b) statutory damages. Because actual damages can be difficult to prove, copyright holders often seek statutory damages instead, which do not require specific proof. A Court has discretion to award statutory damages against an infringer for all infringements of a single work in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000. If the copyright holder proves that the infringement was committed willfully, the amount of statutory damages can increase up to $150,000. If, in contrast, the infringer shows that he was not aware and had no reason to believe that his acts constituted an infringement of a copyright, the Court may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200.[xiv] In addition, a Court may (but is not required to) award a copyright holder its attorney fees incurred in bringing the lawsuit.",

          "Off-road vehicles are specifically exempt from Indiana’s Financial Responsibility laws requiring liability insurance to be in effect for vehicles used on public roads. However, golf carts are not listed among the vehicles that are exempt from financial responsibility requirements while used on public roads. [vi]",
          "Your existing insurance policies may not provide liability insurance for injuries arising from the use of a golf cart. Review your policies and contact your insurance agent to determine if you have coverage. Most homeowners’ insurance policies contain exclusions for liability for injuries arising from the use of a motor vehicle, such as a car or a golf cart. However, some homeowners’ insurance policies may contain an exception for injuries caused by a golf cart which is used only on your insured premises or on the streets within the boundaries of your residential community. If you are relying on such coverage, you will need to know those boundaries and ensure that anyone using the golf cart remains within them. Many companies sell endorsements covering golf carts.",
          "Auto Policies often limit coverage to vehicles designed mainly for use on public roads and most golf carts are not designed for use on public roads. Auto Policies may also exclude coverage for vehicles you own that are not specifically named on the policy, and if they provide coverage for golf carts, they usually require that the insurance company be notified of the purchase within a certain period of time, such as 30 days."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The first step in the leasing process will involve negotiating the “business” terms of the lease, which should be reflected in a letter of intent. These terms will include a description of the space (by size and location), the term of the lease, any renewal options, the rental rate during both the initial term and any renewal options, a description of any work the landlord is required to do in the space, and a statement as to any “tenant improvement allowance” to be provided by the landlord to reimburse the tenant for all or part of the work the tenant performs to improve the space. Although letters of intent are often very brief, a tenant should make sure it includes everything of real importance to the tenant, such as rent concessions and signage."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The next step for most tenants will be reviewing the proposed lease from the landlord, which may well be a lengthy document. Needless to say, reviewing every word of a lengthy lease is a significant undertaking, particularly when you realize that one misplaced word (such as “not”) can create a huge problem. Moreover, the reality is that a typical lease imposes very few obligations on the landlord, while imposing an enormous number of obligations on the tenant. Additionally, it is not unusual to find that the lease does not accurately reflect some of the terms that were agreed to in the letter of intent. Thus, the question a tenant faces is how much effort (and legal expense) is it willing to devote in trying to rewrite the lease to make it fair and accurate, and how cooperative is the landlord likely to be in that effort. Perhaps the only good news here is that most (but not all) landlords are willing to consider revisions to their lease form, so keep in mind that “if you don’t ask, you don’t get.”"

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Here are a few negotiating tips and some potential issues to look for in reviewing a lease. Note: many of these tips are applicable only to multi-tenant properties.:"
      },
      {
        "type": "list",
        "ordered": true,
        "items": [
          "Delivery Date. Although the lease will likely specify a target date for delivery of the space, most leases say that the landlord is not liable if it misses that target. That means that the tenant would remain obligated to take the space whenever the landlord finally delivers it – even years after the target date. Always include a “drop-dead” date by which the space must be delivered or the tenant can terminate the lease.",
          "Pro Rata Share. Leases for multi-tenant properties generally state that each tenant is responsible for its “pro rata share” of the operating costs, real estate taxes, and insurance charges relating to property. Although most leases calculate each tenant’s share as a percentage of the “leasable” space on the property, some landlords will change “leasable” to “leased.” The difference can potentially be enormous. If you are a 5,000 square foot tenant in a 100,000 square foot building, and your pro rata share is based upon “leasable” square feet, your share will be 5 percent. If your share is based on the “leased” square footage of the property, and all the other tenants move out, you will find you suddenly have 100 percent of the leased space and are responsible for 100 percent of these charges!",
          "Reciprocity. A good guiding principle in any lease negotiation is the idea that what is “good for the goose is good for the gander.” For example, if the landlord is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees if it prevails in any lawsuit against the tenant, then the tenant should also be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees if it prevails. If the tenant has to indemnify the landlord for any claim that results from the tenant’s use of the leased space, the landlord should have to indemnify the tenant for any claim that results from the landlord’s operation of any areas that are not under the tenant’s control (such as if someone slips and falls in the lobby of a multi-tenant building or a multi-tenant shopping center.)",
          "Landlord’s Consent. Whenever the landlord’s consent is required for anything under the lease, it should not be unreasonably withheld. The grant or refusal of the landlord’s consent should never be in the landlord’s “sole discretion.” Since leases will often have many provisions where the landlord’s consent is required, the most efficient way to address this concern is simply to include a section at the end of the lease that states: “In any case where the landlord’s consent or approval is required under this lease, such consent or approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.”",
          "Landlord’s Repair Obligations. The landlord’s maintenance and repair obligations are often ridiculously brief. At a minimum, the landlord should be required to maintain the property in compliance with all applicable laws and in a manner comparable to comparable buildings in the same metropolitan area. Specific maintenance obligations imposed on the landlord should include:"

        "text": "6.Landlord’s Insurance and Waiver of Subrogation. Since the landlord’s cost of insuring the property is typically passed through to the tenants on a pro rata basis, a tenant should get the benefit of that insurance. This means that if a tenant accidentally leaves a coffee pot on and burns down the building, the cost of rebuilding should be paid by the landlord’s insurance and the tenant should not be liable to the landlord for that cost. Two things are important here: (1)the lease should require the landlord to maintain full replacement cost coverage; and (2)the lease should contain a mutual “waiver of subrogation” clause providing that neither party will make a claim against the other for any loss that is covered by the injured party’s insurance."

Thus, it is well settled that wrongful death actions are purely statutory, and only damages prescribed by the applicable wrongful death statute may be recovered.

Ristow Trucking Co., the Indiana Supreme Court was asked to decide whether a claim for damages is available in wrongful death actions. 508 N.E.2d 1, 2 (Ind. 1987). The Court observed that the wrongful death statute makes no mention of treble damages, and because the statute is in derogation of common law it must be strictly construed. Id. The Court also noted that the legislature has traditionally limited the elements of damages for which recovery could be had. Id. Despite the statute’s inclusion of the phrase “but not limited to,” the Court decided “this language can not be broadly construed to permit any perceivable damage claim to be available in a wrongful death action.” Id. Ultimately, the Court decided “[t]he confines and limitations inherent in a statutorily based wrongful death action do not permit a claim for treble damages.” Id. at 3."

The Court observed that the Indiana legislature had declined to explicitly authorize punitive damages under the GWDS, despite a consistent line of cases finding punitive damages unavailable. Durham, 745 N.E.2d at 761. The Court also disagreed that there is an identifiable trend in Indiana law in favor of expanding access to punitive damages, noting several instances where the Indiana legislature has explicitly curtailed their availability altogether. Id. at 762. Moreover, the Court reiterated that the goal of the GWDS was to compensate survivors of the wrongful death victim rather than to punish defendants. Id. at 764. Thus, the Court reaffirmed that “punitive damages are not recoverable in a wrongful death action.” Id. at 766."

The Court observed that the CWDS expressly allows for the award of attorneys’ fees, and the Court had previously authorized recovery of attorneys’ fees under the AWDS. Id. at 679. However, the Court also observed that it had previously determined that the GWDS “‘can not be broadly construed to permit any perceivable damage claim to be available in a wrongful death action.’” Id. at 680 (quoting Estate of Kuba, 508 N.E.2d at 2). The Court found the rule announced in Kuba and upheld in Durham controlling, and the Court decided “[a]ttorneys’ fees . . . do not qualify as damages, because since the estate ultimately bears the burden for their payment, such fees do not evolve from a deprivation to a survivor.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Thus, the Court decided “attorneys’ fees are not recoverable as compensatory damages under the GWDS when the decedent leaves a surviving spouse and/or dependents.” Id. at 681."

The Court reiterated that “[p]ecuniary loss is the foundation of a wrongful death action[.]” Id. at 1121. Thus, the damages to which any dependents were entitled “must be tied to pecuniary losses, and those that are related to loss of life, grief, and wounded feelings are not recoverable.” Id. at 1124. The Court also observed that in Ind. Patient’s Comp. Fund v. Patrick, the Indiana Supreme Court held that emotional distress damages are disallowed under the AWDS. Id. (citing 929 N.E.2d 190, 191 (Ind. 2010)). The Court of Appeals cited to Patrick, and similarly concluded that permitting a decedent’s estate to advance a separate claim for emotional distress damages would result in an improper expansion of liability, which is contrary to the principle that only statutorily prescribed damages are allowable under Indiana’s wrongful death statute. Id. For these reasons, the Court concluded the estate’s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was not permitted under the GWDS. Id."

Typically, the issue arises when a treating medical provider receives a subpoena from a party seeking deposition testimony in a personal injury lawsuit brought by the patient. Lawyers often take the position that such witnesses are “fact witnesses” who are only entitled to a statutory witness fee ($5 plus mileage). However, such a position is not applicable when applied to witnesses who are subject to deposition questions as to their professional opinions."

        "text": "First, it is helpful to delineate between “fact witnesses” and “expert witnesses.” Fact witnesses are generally individuals who witness an event and can be called to testify as to their personal knowledge, such as what the witness saw and heard. Expert witnesses are generally individuals who are qualified to offer expert opinions based on their “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” The dilemma discussed herein typically arises when the witness is both a fact witness and an expert witness, such as a physician who treats a patient following a car accident. Such a witness not only has relevant personal knowledge (what injuries the patient suffered), but may also be in a position offer professional opinions (what likely caused the injuries)."

When a physician testifies as an expert, by giving his opinion, he is performing a strictly professional service…If physicians or surgeons can be compelled to render professional services, by giving their opinions on the trial of criminal causes, without compensation, then an eminent physician or surgeon may be compelled to go to any part of the State, at any and all times, to render such service, without other compensation than such as he may recover, as ordinary witness fees, from the defendant in the prosecution, depending upon his conviction and ability to pay. This, under the general principles of law and the constitution of the State, he can not be compelled to do. If he knows facts pertinent to the case to be tried, he must attend and testify as any other witness. In respect to facts within his knowledge, his qualifications as a physician or surgeon are entirely unimportant.

According to the FTC, more than 96% of the public comments it received supported a federal ban of noncompete agreements."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "However, critics have accused the FTC of exceeding its statutory authority and twisting the language of the FTC Act. In a press release, Suzanne Clark, President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the FTC’s rule “not only unlawful, but also a blatant power grab that will undermine American businesses’ ability to remain competitive.” She further stated that “The Chamber will sue the FTC to block this unnecessary and unlawful rule. . .” In fact, several lawsuits seeking to prevent the rule from becoming enforceable have already been filed, and businesses should expect that this rule will be the subject of additional, swift legal challenges brought by employers and various trade associations. It is therefore possible that this rule, as written, never becomes law. However, in the event legal challenges fail and the new rule officially takes effect, it will be a significant change to the U.S. economy and labor market."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In the final rule, the FTC formally concluded that noncompete agreements are an unfair restraint on trade that violates Section 5 of the FTC Act of 1914. The rule bans employers from entering any new noncompete agreements with any workers, including senior executives, after the effective date of the rule (120 days after the rule is formally published in the Federal Register, which has not yet occurred). The rule extends beyond employees to all natural persons serving as independent contractors, externs, interns, volunteers, apprentices, or sole proprietors providing a service to a person. Additionally, the rule extends to both formal contractual provisions and less formal workplace policies — whether written or oral."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "While the rule bans the creation of new noncompete agreements, the FTC adopted a bifurcated approach with respect to existing agreements. Existing noncompete agreements will not be enforceable after the effective date for most workers, but senior executives — those earning more than $151,164.00 per year who are in a “policy-making position” — can still be bound to existing noncompete agreements entered before the effective date, although no new noncompete agreements with senior executives will be allowed. The FTC estimates that senior executives who fall into this definition comprise less than 0.75 percent of workers in the United States."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Exclusivity and conflict-of-interest policies preventing a worker from working for a competitor during their employment/contractual term are not banned. The new rule also does not affect the enforceability of noncompete agreements that arise from the bona fide sale of a business entity, a person’s ownership interest in a business entity, or all (or substantially all) of a business entity’s operating assets. Further, the rule does not retroactively destroy causes of action related to an existing noncompete agreement if they accrue prior to the effective date. Additionally, other common restrictive employment provisions, such as nonsolicitation agreements and nondisclosure agreements are not affected by the rule, provided that such agreements do not “prohibit” or “penalize” a worker from seeking or accepting work from another or operating a business after the conclusion of employment. Therefore, many of the most critical reasons for having restrictive covenants with workers, such as the protection of trade secrets, will remain protected."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "While noncompete agreements remain enforceable through the effective date, employers are required to notify any worker presently bound by a noncompete agreement (other than senior executives) that the noncompete provision will not be enforced against them in the future. The notice must be provided no later than the effective date and can be provided by hand delivery, mail, email, or text message. To assist businesses with compliance, the FTC has provided model notice language in the final rule:"

Plaintiff Edward Zaragoza brought claims of medical malpractice and deliberate indifference for the care he received at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. Plaintiff suffers from hypothyroidism and was prescribed Synthroid® in prison, which caused side effects.

According to Plaintiff’s expert, the “severity and longevity” of these effects meant that Defendants should have discontinued the medication and tried an alternative designed for patients allergic to Synthroid®. Plaintiff’s expert faulted one defendant doctor for persisting in the “ineffective and harmful” treatment, one defendant doctor for advising Plaintiff to take a week’s worth of Synthroid® at once “despite knowing the dangers,” and the third defendant doctor for making “little or no effort” to treat Plaintiff."

Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that a factfinder could find that the defendant doctor acted “contrary to his professional judgment by failing to prescribe an alternative drug that he knew might treat [Plaintiff’s] hypothyroidism without the severe effects of the cheaper and easier Synthroid®,” which would amount to deliberative indifference to a serious medical need."

        "text": "Because there was some evidence that each of the three defendant doctors offered Synthroid® as the only option to treat Zaragoza’s hypothyroidism, despite knowing of its adverse effects and potential safer alternatives, the Supreme Court concluded that a factfinder could interpret the evidence as showing an “obdurate refusal” to move on from plainly inadequate medication, forcing the patient to choose between the intolerable side effect of Synthroid® or untreated hypothyroidism. The Court was concerned that the inmate “may have been denied a basic standard of care that a civilian could expect to receive,” and was persuaded that Plaintiff had met his burden to show a genuine issue for trial.[1]",

Non-compete agreements, also known as covenants not to compete, are contracts that prohibit an individual from working for a competing company or starting a competing business for a certain period of time after leaving their current job. According to the FTC, approximately one in five Americans are bound by some form of non-compete agreement.[2] Non-compete agreements have historically been a matter of state law and are at least somewhat enforceable in 47 states (including Indiana), though they are generally subject to greater judicial scrutiny than other contractual provisions due to their restrictive nature. If the proposed FTC rule becomes a final rule, it would become federal law, at which point it would supersede all state laws related to non-compete agreements.[3]",

First, the proposed rule would not bar other types of contractual employment restrictions, such as non-disclosure agreements and customer or employee non-solicitation agreements (unless such restrictions function as disguised non-compete agreements).[6] Second, the proposed rule does not apply to non-compete agreements binding: 1) a person selling a business entity or otherwise disposing of their entire ownership interest in the business entity; or 2) a person selling substantially all the assets of a business when such person is a substantial owner, member, or partner in the business when entering the non-compete (i.e., holding at least a 25% ownership interest).[7] Third, the proposed rule does not apply to non-compete agreements between franchisees and franchisors, which will remain subject to federal antitrust and other applicable laws.[8]",

However, others may welcome the opportunity to freely recruit and hire workers who are no longer bound by non-compete agreements, which could lead to increased competition and innovation in the marketplace. At a minimum, the proposed rule will likely see a very active public comment period and be subject to at least some revisions before becoming law. Given the FTC’s recent recommitment to its enforcement authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, it appears likely some form of the proposed rule will eventually become law. However, given the significant change in the legal landscape that will result from this proposed rule becoming the law of the land, there will almost certainly be both legislative responses and judicial challenges to the rule if it becomes final."

However, general contractors frequently include language in their form lien waivers that, when signed by the subcontractor, have the effect of waiving not only the subcontractor’s mechanic’s lien rights against the Owner’s property, but also any claim that the subcontractor has against the general contractor arising out of subcontractor’s work at the project to date, including claims for extras, delay, and acceleration."

Buying or selling a business (or the assets of a business) are obvious types of major transactions, but business transactions can also include things like entering corporate shareholder agreements, forming a subsidiary, employing new high-level officers or other key employees, entering leases of real or personal property, and making other large capital purchases of real or personal property. Sometimes a single transaction will be comprised of multiple deals and require numerous written agreements. Even deals that are perceived as “simple” may have many moving pieces and may become quite complex. All too often, we see businesses seeking the assistance of legal counsel very late in the process, such as after a binding letter of intent has been signed or while drafting final written agreements. Regardless of the transaction at issue, it is usually wise to involve your attorneys earlier in the process. Why?"

        "text": "Your attorneys can help by proactively identifying and addressing issues that will likely impact the transaction. For example, if a selling business operates in multiple states, any issues with foreign entity registrations, unemployment insurance, and other similar matters can be identified and corrected early. Missed annual registrations and the like may seem minor in the day-to-day operations of a business, but these problems may have consequences in the context of a transaction. For example, most buyers will want to know a business is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it operates and will expect representations and warranties to that effect. But if an entity no longer has proper authority to do business in a particular state due to a lapsed registration, this could affect the representations and warranties a party can give. Certain issues—particularly those that require the involvement of state-level government agencies—may take weeks or months to resolve, which could delay closing. This, in turn, could give another party the right to back out of the deal or trigger penalties depending on the terms of the parties’ agreement. No matter what the problem is, if it is material to the other party, the consequences could be significant. Even if you are trying to sell your business but do not yet have a buyer, retaining counsel to clean up issues early may help make your business more marketable. In any event, by using attorneys to identify and fix issues in advance, you can, in many cases, speed up the transaction or prevent the need for scrambling to address problems in the days leading up to closing."

In many ways, due diligence and disclosure requirements are like discovery in litigation. Anyone who has been a party to a lawsuit knows just how invasive discovery can be. In the transactional world, due diligence and disclosure requirements may be even more intrusive because there are no objections or third-party neutrals to use as a shield; one side either produces information to the other’s satisfaction or they do not. An attorney can help a client navigate due diligence by working with the other side to ensure the correct documentation is being provided or requested. Further, if you do not involve attorneys with due diligence, serious red flags may go unnoticed because your attorneys would be looking for different things than would your business team."

As the transaction progresses and closing approaches, the amount of time your officers and employees must devote to the transaction will probably increase dramatically. By involving attorneys earlier, you can even out some of this time burden by front-loading the inevitable questions from your attorneys and their requests for information and documents. Moreover, if there were any pre-existing issues with your business that your attorneys addressed early (see Reason 1 above), your attorneys will not have to distract your officers and employees with eleventh-hour requests to gather information, sign forms, issue checks, etc. to solve these problems. Finally, working with your attorneys early may provide peace of mind. The last thing you want for your team is the stress of having your attorney raise serious concerns about the structure or legal impact of a deal after you have already committed to it."

        "text": "Clients (and attorneys, too) often compartmentalize the terms of an agreement into “business terms” and “legal terms.” A prototypical business term is something like the purchase price in an asset purchase agreement or the compensation package offered to a new corporate officer. But it is an oversimplification to say that the lawyer handles the “legal terms,” while the business handles the “business terms.” Sometimes a “business term” also has significant legal consequences. For example, the compensation and benefits package offered to a new officer could have significant tax consequences for the company or the officer or create compliance issues for the business with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). If the business and its new officer had already reached an agreement in principle before calling attorneys, one or both parties might have agreed to costly legal consequences that neither expected. By involving legal counsel before committing to these “business terms,” there is less risk that material, agreed-upon terms will need to change in the final agreement or that a party will ultimately be forced to accept costly or disappointing unintended consequences. If your attorney is engaged early enough, he or she can help identify alternative deal structures if the parties’ initial plan is not viable for whatever reason."

        "text": "Many clients incorrectly assume that retaining lawyers early on will only increase their legal bills. However, this is only sometimes true, and even when it is, there are usually off-setting cost considerations. For starters, the amount of time your attorneys work on a transaction is typically correlated with the scope of what they are being asked to do and the complexity of the transaction—not simply the duration of time they have been retained. If you have specific concerns about costs or the scope of legal services that will be provided, your attorneys should be working with you to ensure appropriate boundaries and expectations are set. Keep in mind that, in many cases, attorneys will address the same issues and spend comparable amounts of time working on a transaction regardless of whether they are retained early or late. Let’s say you are trying to buy another business, and you are deciding between retaining counsel before or after a binding letter of intent is drafted and signed. If you choose to involve your lawyer beforehand, the attorney will bill for things like drafting the letter of intent, for which he or she otherwise would not have billed if you had delayed his or her involvement. However, the attorney’s earlier involvement will also generally mean he or she can provide more options for addressing any legal issues in advance or proposing a more advantageous deal structure. If, for example, the attorney identifies early-on an issue that would have had significant tax consequences, the added value is clear. By contrast, if you had involved the attorney only after the letter of intent was signed, the attorney will still bill time to review the letter and identify the same issues—but you may be left with fewer (and perhaps more costly) solutions for the same problem."

For example, it is relatively easy to form a new business entity on the Indiana Secretary of State’s website and obtain an employer identification number (“EIN”) from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). These steps can be completed in as little as thirty to sixty minutes merely by accessing the two appropriate websites, and they may be done without consulting or seeking advice from experienced legal or accounting professionals.

Failure to properly register a “d/b/a” name could result in a penalty, and it could adversely affect the limited liability protection the entity provides in the first place.

While Indiana’s wrongful death statutes are in derogation of common law and are to be construed strictly against the expansion of liability, Indiana appellate courts have been invited on multiple occasions to interpret the respective damages provisions of the above cited statutes.[4] The CHEAT SHEET below represents a compilation of information gathered from Indiana’s current wrongful death statutes, case law, and Model Civil Jury Instructions[5] and is intended to serve only as a quick reference guide to recoverable damages. This CHEAT SHEET is not intended to be all inclusive nor does it address other wrongful death issues such as standing to bring suit, statute of limitations, the requirement of court approval, the application of other available statutory caps on damages [6], burdens of proof, etc. Also, it is important to remember that each wrongful death action must be carefully analyzed based on the specific facts presented."

When the death of one is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the action shall be commenced by the personal representative of the decedent within two (2) years, and the damages shall be in such an amount as may be determined by the court or jury, including, but not limited to, reasonable medical, hospital, funeral and burial expenses, and lost earnings of such deceased person resulting from said wrongful act or omission. That part of the damages which is recovered for reasonable medical, hospital, funeral and burial expense shall inure to the exclusive benefit of the decedent’s estate for the payment thereof. The remainder of the damages, if any, shall, subject to the provisions of this article, inure to the exclusive benefit of the widow or widower, as the case may be, and to the dependent children, if any, or dependent next of kin, to be distributed in the same manner as the personal property of the deceased. If such decedent departs this life leaving no such widow or widower, or dependent children or dependent next of kin, surviving her or him, the damages inure to the exclusive benefit of the person or persons furnishing necessary and reasonable hospitalization or hospital services in connection with the last illness or injury of the decedent, performing necessary and reasonable medical or surgical services in connection with the last illness or injury of the decedent, to a funeral director or funeral home for the necessary and reasonable funeral and burial expenses, and to the personal representative, as such, for the necessary and reasonable costs and expenses of administering the estate and prosecuting or compromising the action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee, and in case of a death under such circumstances, and when such decedent leaves no such widow, widower, or dependent children, or dependent next of kin, surviving him or her, the measure of damages to be recovered shall be the total of the necessary and reasonable value of such hospitalization or hospital service, medical and surgical services, such funeral expenses, and such costs and expenses of administration, including attorney fees."

If your company is going to have an employee handbook—and every employer should—that handbook should be unique to your company. It is acceptable to start with a “cookie cutter” employee handbook that you copied from a form you found on the Internet, but the final product should be tailored to your company’s specific needs and corporate personality."

The handbook should then specify workers’ status as at-will employees (if that is the case) and provide that the handbook does not create a contract of employment for a specific duration. It is also a good idea to include a statement establishing that the company is an equal opportunity employer. Such a statement will be cited by the company’s employment lawyer in defense of any discrimination claims that may be presented."

For example, it would seem disingenuous to include a policy against the employment of relatives if the company is a family business that already employs relatives. The employee handbook should also contain policies that are factually accurate. It does no good, for instance, to include the federal and state requirements for certain employers to provide accommodations to nursing mothers when in fact no such accommodations are made. Another important consideration is that the policies in the handbook should be relevant to that employer. For example, the handbook may contain a policy implementing the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) (such as providing for 12 weeks of leave and job protection upon return). However, that law only applies to employers of 50 or more employees. If your company has fewer employees, you may implement an FMLA policy, but you are not required to do so by law. On the other hand, if you have more than 50 employees, an appropriate FMLA policy should be included in the employee handbook."

An important component of such a policy is whether the company will pay for accrued but unused vacation or PTO upon termination of employment. The general rule in Indiana is that an employer must pay accrued but unused vacation time upon termination of employment unless it has a written policy to the contrary. Nothing upsets a company owner more than not paying accrued but unused vacation time to an employee who was terminated for misconduct who then files a claim with the Indiana Department of Labor seeking accrued but unused vacation pay, only to learn that the company did not have a written policy that provided that no such pay is due. Having such a written policy alone will more than compensate the company for the cost of having its employee handbook reviewed for compliance with the law."

This task often gets put off when more pressing needs, such as sales and operations, take precedence. The same is true when a company has an outdated employee handbook. Employment laws change frequently, so your existing handbook should be reviewed every couple of years to make sure your policies are current.

After running a conflict check and engaging my attorney-client, I first review the law firm’s partnership agreement. As often as not, the terms of the partnership agreement (a) bear little resemblance to the law firm’s operations, past or present, often because the agreement was copied from another firm with a very different structure; (b) ignores the subject of a partner’s separation, or (c) describes a separation process that is incomplete or unworkable. In such circumstances, the partnership agreement can hinder, rather than facilitate, the partner’s separation from the law firm. The better course is to review your law firm’s partnership agreement every few years—during periods when there is consensus among the law firm partners—to make sure it reflects the partnership’s current operations and business model and describes a fair process for both the firm and the separating partner."

Because of the ability to limit the owners’ personal liability, and given the minimal cost of registering with the state as a corporation or a limited liability company, it is almost always advisable for a business to operate as a corporation or an LLC rather than as a sole proprietor or partnership.

The purpose of a buy-sell agreement is to give the business and its owners the right to repurchase the interest of an owner in the event of that owner’s death, termination of employment, or any proposed transfer of that owner’s interest. Thus, in the example above, a typical buy-sell agreement would give Mary the right to buy back Joe’s ownership interest upon the termination of his employment at a set purchase price so that Joe would then cease to be an owner in the business. A typical buy-sell agreement would also prevent an owner from selling that owner’s interest to anyone else unless that interest was first offered to the other owner(s) on the same terms.",

        "text": "In 1975, the Indiana legislature created the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act (“MMA”), which outlines the process for selecting a Medical Review Panel to review claims of medical malpractice filed against qualifying health care providers. As a matter of background, not all health care providers are entitled to the protections of the MMA, and not all claims filed against health care providers fall under the MMA (for discussion of claims that fall outside the boundaries of the MMA, click here). To be covered by the MMA, a health care provider (which can include a hospital, nursing home, surgery center, physician, nurse, chiropractor, pharmacist, dentist, or athletic trainer) must purchase an appropriate insurance policy and file specific paperwork to be considered a “Qualified provider” under the MMA (Ind. Code § 34-18-2-24.5). In Indiana, certain providers are considered “Qualified providers” which are entitled to the benefits of the MMA, while other providers decide to forgo qualification status for various reasons and therefore forfeit the benefits of the MMA. To determine whether you are a Qualified provider or not, you should contact your professional liability insurance carrier or the Indiana Department of Insurance, visit website.",

        "text": "For qualified providers, one of the primary benefits of coverage under the MMA besides the statutory cap on damages is the Medical Review Panel (“MRP”) process. The MRP process is a quasi-peer review process in which three health care providers are jointly selected by the parties to review a medical malpractice claim against a Qualified provider. Parties can generally begin the MRP selection process at any time. However, there may be tactical reasons to delay the MRP selection process until more information is known about the claim. For example, it is common for the parties to wait until initial discovery is complete before they commence the MRP selection process."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "1. The first step in the MRP process is selection of the Panel Chair. The Panel Chair is a neutral third-party attorney who assists the parties in seating the MRP. The Panel Chair is paid by the prevailing party, and the fees for the Panel Chair and Panel Members are limited by statute to $2,500 for the Panel Chair and $500 for each Panel Member. In practice, there is a reasonably small pool of experienced Panel Chairs in the State of Indiana. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement regarding a Panel Chair, the MMA outlines a cumbersome process that includes a striking panel of five random attorneys from a selected geographic area selected by the Clerk of the Indiana Supreme Court. The parties take turns striking nominees until one attorney remains. The selected attorney is notified of his or her appointment and is expected to serve unless he or she can show good cause for removal. This striking panel process is usually avoided at all costs because the parties may end up with a Panel Chair with no experience with the MRP process and no interest in serving as a Panel Chair."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "2. The second step in the MRP process involves the selection process for the three voting members of the MRP. The Panel Chair is technically a non-voting member of the MRP, and the voting members are generally referred to as the Panelists. The Panelists must be health care providers licensed in the State of Indiana. Typically, the patient/plaintiff has the right to select one of the Panelists, the defendant health care provider(s) jointly select one of the Panelists, and those selected Panelists choose the third Panelist. The selection process can be done by nomination or striking panel. Either party may nominate a health care provider for consideration by the opposing party. However, the opposing party may strike a nominee without cause and without stating a reason. In practice, many Panelists are selected via striking panels. A striking panel consists of three health care providers, usually of a particular specialty, who are randomly selected by the Panel Chair. The parties take turns striking nominees, and the remaining nominee is selected to serve. For example, the patient/plaintiff may request a striking panel of cardiologists. The Panel Chair will send the parties a list of three randomly selected cardiologists and ask the defendant(s)/health care provider(s) to jointly submit the first strike. After the defendants submit their strike, the patient/plaintiff gets to determine which nominee to strike (and the remaining nominee will be asked to serve on the MRP). Defendant’s nominee may be selected in a similar manner, with the plaintiff submitting the first strike. In practice, many third Panelist nominees are selected via striking panels as well. The striking order for the third panelist nominee is usually decided by a coin flip by the Panel Chair. Generally, the parties may request a panel of any specialty they desire. For example, nothing prohibits a party from requesting a striking panel of cardiologists for a case related to orthopedic care. The only guidance under the MMA relates to a scenario where a single defendant is an individual/person, such as in a case against only one physician. Under such a scenario, at least two Panelists must be of the same specialty as the defendant. In practice, most MRPs generally match the specialty make-up of the defendant health care providers. However, cases filed against multiple health care providers, especially those involving more than three specialties, can create difficult choices regarding which specialties will not be represented on the MRP."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "3. The third step in the MRP process (after all three Panelists are selected) is the submission process. The Panel Chair establishes a submission schedule, and the parties draft and tender their respective submissions for review by the MRP. The submission process has primarily been developed by custom and practice, instead of pursuant to any strict procedural rules under the MMA. For instance, in the early days of the MMA, parties would provide the MRP copies of the pertinent medical records and ask the Panelists to review all the issues with very little guidance as to what was being alleged. For the past several decades, parties have tendered narrative submissions that summarize the medical care and case issues. Usually these narrative submissions are written by an attorney and include medical records or other persuasive evidence as exhibits. Customs have also developed around the general process for drafting and distributing the submissions. Generally, a plaintiff tenders his or her submission first. The submission is sent to the parties and Panel Chair, but not the Panelists. Next, defendants tender their submission and address the arguments in the plaintiff’s submission. Sometimes, there is a rebuttal process involving reply submissions, sur-reply submissions, and even sur-sur-reply submissions, in which each side fights to have the “last word.” Once all submissions, responses, and replies are tendered, the Panel Chair will send each Panelist copies of all the submissions, responses, and replies at the same time. The Panel Chair then schedules a meeting of the MRP, typically via teleconference or videoconference. The meeting of the MRP is intended to be an informal discussion among the Panelists regarding the merits of the claim. The MMA also allows either party to convene the MRP for questioning, but convening MRPs is relatively uncommon, largely because the parties are only allowed to ask benign questions and cannot discuss core issues involved in the case with the MRP. Either way, after the meeting of the MRP is complete, a panel opinion is agreed to and circulated for signature. The parties often receive a copy of the panel opinion within 30 days of the MRP meeting."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "After the panel opinion is issued, the MRP process is complete. At that point, a patient/plaintiff may either pursue a formal lawsuit in state court or forgo further legal action, often depending on the outcome of the panel opinion. If a patient/plaintiff files a state court lawsuit, the panel opinion is admissible evidence at trial (I.C. § 34-18-10-23). The MRP process can be very beneficial and persuasive because the jury will be advised that the MRP process entails an impartial review of the case by three independent health care providers jointly selected by the parties. If a lawsuit is pursued, either party may still present expert witness testimony to support or refute the opinion from the MRP, but juries generally find the panel opinion persuasive. For the reasons stated above, parties should consider the MRP process as a “mini-trial” and make every effort to seat a high-quality MRP. A high-quality MRP will often lead to a favorable panel opinion."

Further, while the author of a copyrightable expressive work automatically owns a copyright in the expressive work (with certain exceptions for works authored by employees or independent contractors of a company), copyright registration provides the owner greater ownership recognition and stronger protections, including the availability of statutory monetary damages if the registered copyright is infringed. Similarly, a business may possess certain state common law rights in an unregistered trademark used in a particular geographical market, but obtaining a federally registered trademark provides national recognition and awareness of that trademark across multiple states, which precludes national competitors from using the same or similar trademarks for their goods or services."

        "text": "In contrast, a business cannot obtain protections for trade secrets through registration. Instead, a business must enact reasonable policies and procedures to protect the secrecy of its identified trade secrets from public view, such as limiting access to trade secrets to only those individuals who need to know them, carefully disposing of any unneeded documents including trade secret information, and providing training on how to handle trade secret information. When a business’s employees or independent contractors must have access to a particular trade secret, it is common to protect that trade secret by requiring the employees or independent contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements, in which the employees or independent contractors agree not to share confidential or proprietary trade secret information with any person or entity."

Following a decision by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the dismissal, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to take up this case to determine whether the FNHRA creates private rights of action for individuals to bring against government-funded nursing homes.

        "text": "For example, Indiana Appellate Rule 9(A) generally requires that a party seeking an appeal from an appealable order file a Notice of Appeal within thirty (30) days after entry of the order. A party that fails to timely file the Notice of Appeal forfeits the right to appeal the trial court’s order. Discretionary interlocutory appeals are even more fraught for practitioners and parties alike. This type of appeal generally follows an order issued in the middle of a lawsuit, such as a discovery order or the denial of a motion for summary judgment. Under Indiana Appellate Rule 14, a party first must ask the trial court to certify its order for an interlocutory appeal. Then, the party must ask the Indiana Court of Appeals to accept jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal. As the name implies, the trial court and the Court of Appeals have discretion to grant or deny these requests. If the trial court certifies an order for an interlocutory appeal and the Court of Appeals (by decision of its motions panel) accepts jurisdiction, the appealing party then has 15 days to file a Notice of Appeal."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "A recent line of appellate decisions demonstrates the strict nature of these deadlines. On February 9, 2021, the Indiana Supreme Court issued an order in Cooper’s Hawk Indianapolis, LLC v. Ray, 162 N.E.3d 1097 (Ind. 2021). In Cooper’s Hawk, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The trial court certified its order for interlocutory appeal, and the Court of Appeals accepted jurisdiction. The defendant filed its Notice of Appeal five days late, and the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on timeliness grounds. The defendant argued the belated appeal should be allowed to proceed because it presents a substantial question of law. The Court of Appeals’ motions panel denied the motion to dismiss, allowing the appeal to proceed. The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the trial court’s denial of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff sought transfer, which the Indiana Supreme Court granted, vacating the Court of Appeals’ decision. On transfer, the Supreme Court observed that, even after an appellant has forfeited the right to appeal, an Indiana appellate court nevertheless may choose to accept jurisdiction and thus address the merits of the appeal. However, the Court emphasized that for an appellant’s untimely—and thus forfeited—appeal to be reinstated, the appellant must show there are “extraordinarily compelling reasons why this forfeited right should be restored” or the trial court’s order must be “manifestly unjust.” The Court concluded there were no extraordinarily compelling reasons to restore the defendant’s forfeited appeal, and the Court thus dismissed the appeal and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Similarly, in Syndicate Claim Servs. v. Trimmel, 21A-PL-1231, issued on December 8, 2021, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment on one of the plaintiff’s claims. Upon the defendant’s motion, the trial court certified its order for interlocutory appeal, and the Court of Appeals accepted jurisdiction. However, the defendant filed its Notice of Appeal one week late and filed a “Verified Motion to Accept Belated Notice of Appeal for Interlocutory Appeal.” The plaintiff moved to dismiss the defendant’s appeal on timeliness grounds. The Court of Appeals’ motions panel denied the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss and granted the defendant’s motion for a belated appeal. The Court of Appeals observed that, while Indiana law does not provide ample guidance regarding what constitute “extraordinarily compelling reasons” for an appellate court to accept jurisdiction over a forfeited appeal, cases restoring appeals tend to fall into two categories: (1) cases involving fundamental liberty interests, such as the right to maintain a parent-child relationship or the right to bail; and (2) cases involving “obvious injustice,” such as a trial court’s clear violation of child support guidelines. The Court of Appeals noted that Cooper’s Hawk did not fit into either category, and there were no other extraordinarily compelling reasons to restore the forfeited appeal in that case; thus, the Supreme Court concluded the appeal should be dismissed. Similarly, following the Supreme Court’s guidance, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court’s decision did not fit into either category, and there were no other extraordinarily compelling reasons to restore it. The Court of Appeals thus concluded the defendant forfeited its right to interlocutory appeal of the trial court’s order and dismissed the appeal. (Note: As of January 18, 2022, the Chronological Case Summary for this appellate matter indicates that the defendant filed a Petition for Rehearing on January 10, 2022, which asks the Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision. That Petition remains pending, and no Petition for Transfer has yet been filed.)"

Each governmental opportunity typically requires that some portion of awarded contracts for work include minority-owned or other recognized disadvantaged businesses; thus, contractors frequently seek out such businesses to award subcontract work for such a project. This article addresses the main requirements for a business to obtain certification as a minority-owned or other recognized disadvantaged business to qualify to receive such subcontract work."

Applicants must provide documents such as birth certificates, tax returns, passports, resumes, pending contracts, payments/invoicing, and company records including minutes and tax returns. Before proceeding to seek certification with any agency, a would-be applicant should read the checklist of items required as part of an application to determine if the desire for certification justifies the sharing of such information. Having counsel familiar with this process can also assist applicants in appropriate redactions or other measures to protect as much confidential information as possible from public access or disclosure."

These terms may vary depending on applicable certifying agency — for example a business may instead be called “WOSB” for woman-owned small business or “VOSB” for one that is veteran-owned. A business seeking certification must be majority-owned and controlled by a “qualifying member” of one of the foregoing groups. For example, applicable law defines “minorities” as Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and similar minority groups. And “disadvantaged” is defined by applicable law as the foregoing minority persons or other qualifying disadvantaged persons whose (current) personal net worth falls below $1.32 million and whose entity’s prior three-year average gross receipts (presently) do not exceed $26.29 million."

Other relevant certifying agencies include the federal Small Business Administration (SBA) and an early-established for-profit company commonly known as WBENC (Women Business Enterprise National Council), upon which several large private companies have relied for certification. Other states, regions, and agencies also provide various certifications and generally follow the same basic requirements. There are reciprocal arrangements between various certifying agencies as well, so a company wishing to seek multiple certifications should research (or hire experienced counsel) to plan the best route to take advantage of such arrangements."

          "To be eligible for certification in one of the applicable groups, the qualifying member must own at least 51 percent of the applicant company with an interest in the company’s capital, assets, profits, and losses proportionate to that ownership percentage. In other words, if applying for WBE certification, the woman as a qualifying member must own at least 51 percent of the company and have requisite “skin in the game” for that ownership. More than one woman can constitute the 51 percent ownership level if they meet all other requirements for certification. If her purchase is financed, it must be arms-length from standard or third-party lenders rather than seller-financed, especially if the seller is not a qualifying member. Moreover, the purchase of the 51 percent interest must be legitimately based on an appraisal or other acceptable valuation method; an applicant owner paying a nominal amount for a valuable company will be highly scrutinized and possibly denied certification. In fact, nearly all the regulations prohibit certification for companies who restructure simply to obtain XBE certification; instead, they must have a business reason or purpose for any restructuring that results in eligibility for certification. Common business reasons are business succession planning, like when a qualifying member has been promoted over time and acquires at least 51 percent ownership, or the death/illness of a non-qualified founder or majority owner that causes ownership change to eligible status.",
          "Another requirement for certification is that the qualifying member must “control” the entity by managing and having an active role in the company’s day-to-day operations. Here, the relevant agency will review the corporate organizational records to ensure that the qualifying member has the requisite control over the entity, either by having a 51 percent controlling vote or by being the sole Board member. Essentially, the qualifying member must be the highest-ranked officer without reporting to any non-qualifying member. The agency will review compensation records to discover if the qualifying member is the highest-compensated. The agency will also review contracts to ensure the qualifying member is participating in the business, and it may interview key vendors or staff to determine whether the qualifying member is truly running the company. If the entity must be licensed to run its business, the qualifying member must hold that license. The resume of the qualifying member will also be scrutinized for the requisite expertise to manage the company, and the regulations generally deny that someone previously in human resources or marketing has such capacity. Other business interests are also evaluated to determine whether the qualifying member is working full time in operating the applicant company."

She has also helped obtain XBE certification for clients who were initially denied certification when they applied without the assistance of experienced counsel. There are pitfalls along the path to certification, so it is highly recommended that businesses utilize counsel who are experienced in this subject matter to minimize delays and uncertainties regarding certification. Costly and timely appeals or awaiting the one-year reapplication period may be avoided by hiring qualified counsel from the start."

As counsel, we often want to be included in this step of the investigation, but we are not always afforded the opportunity due to circumstances beyond our control. If we are included, however, we should ask as many questions as possible of the person or entity engaging us to participate. These questions should include: what are the theories for including my client in the investigation? What other parties should appear? Is the insurance carrier on notice if this is a residential dwelling? Will the insurance carrier have a representative present? If counsel represents a product manufacturer, we should consider asking whether there are any suppliers who should be notified of the loss. If there are parties whose identity is known at the time of the loss but who are not invited to the scene, this could present issues in the litigation."

In that case, the subcontractor knows what the prime contractor’s obligations are to the owner and can negotiate subcontract provisions that are less onerous to the subcontractor but are sufficient to allow the prime contractor to satisfy its obligations to the owner (e.g., indemnification, claim notice deadlines, and retainage and other payment terms). Third, even if the prime contractor refuses to make any meaningful concessions, the process of preparing for the negotiation should cause the subcontractor to review carefully and understand the terms of the subcontract and the prime contract before work begins, with the result that the subcontractor will be better positioned to avoid disputes and to resolve amicably those disputes that cannot be avoided."

To avoid this error, good contractors double-check the scope of work as part of their bid preparation. Contractors should use the same care in reviewing the scope of work described in their contracts prior to signing them. This is of particular concern to subcontractors because the prime contractors often take responsibility for preparing and assembling the subcontract documents and (occasionally) add scopes of work to the subcontracts without increasing the subcontract prices. Depending on the circumstances, a subcontractor may have a legal remedy against the prime contractor for the scope error.

A company will often obtain insurance to assist with the funding of a repurchase arising out of the death or disability of a shareholder, although the premiums paid are not tax-deductible."

In contrast to a cross-purchase agreement (discussed below), only one policy per shareholder is necessary. In the case of a repurchase obligation not funded (or not fully funded) by insurance, the company may have greater resources to make the required payment than would the individual shareholders, including the ability to borrow the required funds, if necessary. Moreover, if for any reason the corporation were unable to fulfill its obligation to pay for the shares, the remaining shareholders would have no personal liability for that payment."

In addition, there are a number of potential tax disadvantages. To the extent that a company wanted to reserve funds to assist with any repurchase not covered (or not fully covered) by insurance proceeds, the owners would nonetheless be taxed on the reserved funds if the company is a pass-through entity (such as an S-Corporation or an LLC that is taxed as a partnership), and the set-aside funds could be subject to the accumulated earnings tax liability in the case of a C-Corporation. Additionally, the redemption of a shareholder’s shares by the company will not have the same favorable effect on the tax basis of the other shareholders as would be the case with a cross-purchase agreement (see below). Lastly, in the case of a family-owned business, certain attribution rules may apply, as a result of which the redemption price could be treated as a dividend for tax purposes."

For example, if A owns 100 shares, B owns 50 shares, C owns 50 shares, and C dies, A would repurchase 2/3’s of C’s shares (since A owns 2/3’s of the combined total of A and B’s shares) and B would purchase the remaining 1/3 of C’s shares. A typical cross-purchase agreement will require each shareholder to purchase life insurance on each of the other shareholders to provide the purchasing shareholder with the money to fund the repurchase obligation. Once again, however, the premiums paid for this insurance coverage are not tax-deductible."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "One advantage of a cross-purchase agreement exists in the case of the death of a shareholder, where life insurance proceeds are payable to the purchasing shareholders. To the extent that a shareholder then uses his/her share of these tax-free proceeds to purchase shares of the selling shareholder, the purchasing shareholder will have a corresponding increase in the tax basis of his/her shares. So, for example, if a shareholder had originally purchased 100 shares of stock in the company for a total $1,000 when it was first formed many years ago, and he now purchases 50 additional shares upon the death of one of the other shareholders using $50,000 of life insurance proceeds, the purchasing shareholder will now own 150 shares of stock with a tax basis of $51,000. As a result, A has used his $50,000 in tax-free life insurance proceeds to increase his basis by $50,000, which will ultimately reduce his tax liability by $50,000 when he sells his shares. Note also that, while company-owned life insurance policies are subject to the claims of the company’s creditors, individually owned policies are not subject to the claims of the individual’s creditors under Indiana law."

First, each shareholder will need to rely on his/her fellow shareholders to maintain the necessary insurance in force, and to have sufficient solvency to fulfill his/her purchase obligation in the case of an uninsured event that triggers a purchase obligation. Second, maintaining the required insurance policies becomes administratively cumbersome if there are more than two shareholders. For example, if there are three shareholders (A, B, and C), six insurance policies will need to be in place: A would have policies on B and C, B would have policies on A and C, and C would have policies on A and B. If there are four shareholders, twelve policies would need to be put in place. Third, there could be significant differences in the premiums that each shareholder would be required to pay as a result of age differences and medical issues affecting the individuals insured by those policies. Although it is possible to address some or all of these disadvantages by having the required policies owned by a trust of which the shareholders are the beneficiaries, that creates certain additional expenses and complexities."

        "text": "Hybrid buy-sell agreements can create certain rights and obligations for both the company and the shareholders. For example, a hybrid agreement could create a cross-purchase obligation among the shareholders in the case of death, where the obligation can be fully insured, but provide for a redemption by the company in instances where the repurchase obligation is not insurable (such as upon a shareholder’s retirement). Alternatively, a hybrid agreement could provide the shareholders with an option to purchase the offered shares on a pro-rata basis, with the corporation then having the option or obligation (depending upon how the agreement is structured) to purchase any shares not purchased by the shareholder. Thus, a hybrid buy-sell agreement can help avoid some of the disadvantages of both redemption agreements and cross-purchase agreements."

Under Indiana’s Dram Shop Act, a person who “furnishes” alcohol to another may be liable for damages (including injury or death) caused by the other person’s intoxication if the furnisher had actual knowledge that the person who consumed the alcohol was visibly intoxicated when the alcohol was furnished.

For example, Indiana’s courts have determined that a person “furnishes” alcoholic beverages to another person when one is the “active means” by and through which the alcohol is placed in the other person’s control. This may occur by purchasing beverages on the other person’s behalf, by knowingly allowing another to take possession of beverages, by selling the beverages to a third person with knowledge that the third person intends to furnish them to another, or by buying another person a drink.

The deceased guest’s estate sued one of the co-hosts in part under the Dram Shop Act, arguing that the co-host was negligent because she “furnished” alcohol to the other co-host who killed the party guest. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the co-host on the Dram Shop claim because the co-host did not “furnish” alcohol to the other co-host. On transfer, the Indiana Supreme Court observed that the term “furnish” in the context of the Dram Shop Act requires transfer of possession of the alcohol. Because both co-hosts owned the alcohol jointly, neither could transfer possession to the other, therefore neither could have “furnished” alcohol to the other.

        "text": "Back when I graduated from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in December of 1978, those of us who were beginning our careers believed their job options were limited to working for law firms or government agencies. Over the years, however, there was a third option: working as an in-house legal professional for a private company, a position which has grown in stature and importance to the businesses they serve. This column is dedicated to reviewing the pluses and minuses that come from working in-house and, as they say, “the grass is always greener on the other side.” It is my belief, having worked on both sides — spending a number of years as general counsel for a medium-sized insurance company as well as two stints in private practice — that it truly is only a different shade of green."

        "text": "In-house legal teams can vary in size, scope and responsibility. From a single attorney to large in-house legal teams, here are some of the main differences to consider if you’re thinking about going in-house. First of all, the most popular level of experience for in-house hires is between three to six years in private practice. The reason for this is that in-house teams are simply not set up to train new lawyers when compared to private practice. Often when an attorney is switching from private practice to coming in-house, it is a win-win experience for the firm, as the attorney going in house understands and knows the legal needs of the business he or she will be serving and is well thought of as a problem solver with a high level of legal acumen particularly important to the business. For matters needing outside counsel assistance, the attorney going in-house is likely to contact his or her old colleagues for assistance, and the firm’s ties to a client are actually strengthened for the long-term."

Important attributes for in-house attorneys are problem-solving, being a team player, responsiveness, and having a proactive nature to take action to make necessary changes within the company. While compensation is essential, 60-plus-hour work weeks and endless paperwork that accompanies billing in six-minute increments can be draining. Working in a team environment versus “eating what you kill” is attractive to many accomplished people. While a mid-sized firm (20-60 attorneys) can offer a good combination of solid training in a variety of legal specialties, along with a good salary and early hands-on experience, bottom line, no matter what the size, working at a law firm means your needs often have to take a back seat to the client’s needs: keeping them happy as long as what they request is moral, ethical and legal. Firms of all sizes stay financially successful primarily based on how much they can bill their clients. Charging by tenths of an hour, every minute that attorneys aren’t billing is “lost” time that otherwise could be used to generate revenue. Because clients are critical to a firm’s livelihood, associates must look to eventually be responsible for bringing in new business or rainmaking. While the potential to earn big bucks may lure many young lawyers to the big-firm life, the cost of giving up control over your personal life may be significant. “If the client needs you there on Saturday and Sunday, you’ll be there!”"

For the past year, most lawyers have been conducting depositions, mediations, and client meetings from their home offices. While the intellectual preparation required for these events has remained the same, the format of our preparation has changed. Lawyers are regularly using virtual meeting platforms to meet with clients, interview witnesses, and conduct discovery. The travel associated with these events in the past has been substantially reduced, if not eliminated. Since many lawyers charge by the hour for their services, clients have seen a reduction in their litigation expenses since lawyers are no longer compelled to travel throughout the country to pursue and defend litigation. Clients have welcomed this change and have saved substantial amounts of fees as a result."

Spaulding v. Int’l Bakers Serv., 550 N.E.2d 307 (Ind. 1990). In other words, disability exists while the person is unable to earn equal wages in the person’s work or in work for another employer. Consequently, an employee who has an allergic reaction to an irritant may not be able to establish disablement if that employee could earn equal wages for another employer where that irritant would not be present. However, an employee who is hospitalized or in mandatory quarantine for a COVID-19 infection would likely be considered “disabled” during any period while the employee was unable to work for any employer. If the employee is asymptomatic, or is not subject to quarantine, he or she would not be considered “disabled” once permitted to return to work."

The Immunity Provision does not bar the claim.

Yet, the requirements under each scheme are different. IDOA projects require a payment bond equal to the contract price when the project’s estimated cost is greater than $200,000.00.[x] Similarly, a payment bond is required for local public works contracts estimated to exceed $200,000.00.[xi] However, the local government entity can, at its election, require payment bonds for smaller contracts.[xii] Conversely, state agency projects generally require a payment bond in an amount equal to the contract price, unless the contract is with a state educational institution and less than $500,000.00.[xiii]",

For local and state agency projects, the Subcontractor must file duplicate signed statements of the amount due with the government entity (with a copy to the contractor), but it is the government entity’s responsibility to notify the surety of the claim.[xxviii]",

While contract payments are withheld as soon as proper notice is provided, proceeding against the surety involves additional timing components. A Subcontractor must wait, in all cases, at least 30 days before bringing an action against the surety after it provides proper notice.[xxix] For IDOA claims, the action against the surety must be brought within one year after the general contractor receives final payment.[xxx] However, for state agency and local projects, the Subcontractor must file an action against the surety no later than 60 days after the completion and acceptance of the public project.[xxxi] These deadlines are particularly important for non-payment claims that arise shortly before the project’s final acceptance. In such a case, a Subcontractor may not have a full 60 days to provide notice because it must also comply with both the 30-day waiting period and the requirement to file an action against the surety within 60 days after final acceptance of the public work.",

It is easy to discern why Indiana courts require strict compliance with the statute’s notice provisions.”[xxxii] In this Seventh Circuit case, a subcontractor on a local project had sent its nonpayment notice directly to the surety, which the court held was legally invalid because the statute requires notice to be sent to the appropriate government board to forward to the surety.[xxxiii] The court also noted that the government entity was not properly on notice to withhold general contract payments because the notice at issue only referenced recovery under the “Payment and Performance Bonds.”[xxxiv] Similarly, the Indiana Court of Appeals has noted that when a contractor fails to comply with the statutory requirements, the government entity is under no obligation to withhold payments to the general contractor.[xxxv]",

The steps to minimize such risks will be required for the months to come and include establishing and instituting safety protocols such as temperature monitoring, mask use requirements, hand sanitizing, and social distancing. Some businesses have taken the additional step of requiring customers or clients to sign a written agreement with a goal of insulating the business from liability for COVID-related claims. These agreements (hereinafter referred to as COVID Agreements) include release and/or indemnity language. The purpose of this article is to discuss the law pertaining to release and indemnity agreements in general and language that should be included in COVID Agreements to provide that broadest possible protection."

These agreements must be clear and unequivocal and are strictly construed.[10] Accordingly, the indemnifying agreement must expressly state in clear and unequivocal terms that negligence is an area of application and that it applies to the indemnification of the indemnitee by the indemnitor for the indemnitee’s own negligence.[11]",

Schools and buildings have been shut down, and many thousands of people have lost their jobs or have been forced to tighten their economic belts. It stands to reason that, as a result, the number of uninsured or underinsured people with otherwise limited assets is dramatically increasing. Additionally, many people are spending more and more time at home out of necessity or caution, but as people have begun to experiment with more social interaction after months of isolation, in-home gatherings of family and friends have become more frequent. Yet, there are many types of injuries which can occur at home, such as personal injuries caused by dog bites, trampoline or pool usage, accusations of slander or libel, and falls by people on your property. Potential liability from these injuries can threaten your own assets. In light of this risk, there are two simple and affordable steps you can take today to help protect the assets, well-being, and peace-of-mind of you and your family members in the future.",

For example, if you purchase liability coverage of $250,000 per person and $500,000 total per accident to protect your family’s assets in the event you cause an accident which injures another person and/or damages their property, you can also purchase UM/UIM coverage in an equal amount. Doing so allows you or your insured family member to recover up to this amount from your own insurance company if another driver who causes the injury/damages has no insurance or insufficient insurance coverage. The cost for this type of coverage can vary depending upon factors such as age and driving record, but it is often less than $100 per vehicle per year. While it is often dismissed by policyholders as an unnecessary expense, it is worthy of consideration because of its clear utility and reasonable price."

While it is not mandated that UM/UIM coverage be included in personal umbrella policies (and not all insurers offer this coverage in their umbrella policies), you should elect this option if it is available to you, and if it is not, you should strongly consider finding a policy with a UM/UIM option from another insurer. Like with UM/UIM coverage, the cost of umbrella policies is relatively modest. For example, for around $500 per year you can purchase a personal umbrella policy for $1 million in additional coverage. Approximately one-half of that amount would be the cost of the additional UM/UIM coverage. In purchasing an umbrella policy, you get the added protection of up to a million dollars (or whatever limit you choose) instead of your other underlying policy limits to protect your family’s assets in the event of a liability claim against you. If you elect optional UM/UIM coverage in the umbrella policy, the extra coverage ceiling will also extend to injuries or property damage that you or your family members suffer as a result of the actions of a person with inadequate automobile or homeowners insurance coverages.",

The pandemic has many contractors rethinking their growth plans for 2020 and beyond. Contractors in some states were required to stop work for months.

In bad economic times when there is less work, established contractors adjust by trimming their staffs to retain their best management and labor teams, which means a higher percentage of their projects are being handled by their best people. In good economic times when work is abundant, contractors are tempted to take all the work they can get, without considering whether they have enough qualified management and labor to perform that work, with the result that contractors find themselves using inexperienced managers and employees on complicated projects. When “C” project teams are being asked to perform “A” work, their projects can quickly become disasters — and one disaster can put even an established contractor out of business. Successful contractors have the discipline to honestly evaluate their available teams and to walk away from prospective work for which they lack qualified project teams."

Bonding companies typically like to see their contractors maintain working capital between 5% to 10% of the amount of their total work programs, but the amount required can be more or less depending on the surety and the contractor’s circumstances.

As well, the forms require that the applicant provide all material information which often includes personal and company tax returns, bank and corporate records, and contracts. After receipt of the application, most certifying agencies conduct an on-site interview of the qualifying member that “tests” and confirms that the qualifications are met. The agencies also reserve the right to inspect equipment or other assets on-site or in the field and interview the company’s vendors, subcontractors, bankers, and employees to vet the qualification standards. While it is unclear the extent to which onsite interviews may be affected by the recent pandemic shutdown (i.e., if they will be offered telephonically or by videoconference), they are a crucial step in the process such that companies should pay due attention to preparing for them."

Some are simple and can readily be remedied, such as failure to include all supporting documentation. Others take time, such as satisfying a requirement that the company has been in business at least two years or otherwise sufficiently prove it is worthy and reliable to be awarded governmental contracts. Deeper problems include the existence of corporate governance documents that affect control requirements, unexplained disparity in compensation as to the qualifying member, and inadequate capital contribution or collateralization when qualifying members obtain their majority ownership through financing by the seller or family members who do not qualify for certification."

Within 90-120 days of applying, a company should learn whether certification has been granted. Certification is typically valid for three years so long as nothing changes to disqualify the company. The company usually must file an annual affidavit attesting that no such changes occurred. If certification is denied, the qualifying member is best advised to withdraw the application so that deficiencies can be addressed and allow the company to promptly reapply. If it instead suffers a denial, there is usually a one-year bar against reapplying."

Trademarks and service marks can include words, phrases, symbols, or designs used to help your products stand out from the competition in the marketplace. However, there are several things to consider to maximize the value of your marks. Here are five key considerations to maximize the value of your trademark or service mark."

          "What kind of mark do you want? Like many other assets, trademarks and service marks may come in many shapes and sizes. First, a trademark identifies and distinguishes the origin of a specific good available in commerce, whereas a service mark identifies and distinguishes the origin of a specific service. For example, Coca-Cola® is a trademark for soft drink products, but DoorDash®, which provides food delivery services without selling its own products, is a service mark. Trademarks and service marks may take the form of words or phrases (known as “standard character” marks), or as symbols or designs (known as design marks). Unlike a standard character mark that only includes alphanumeric characters, a design mark may protect specific colors, patterns, fonts, or other images associated with your goods or services. If a particular good has specific, identifiable packaging that sets it apart from other products on the market, such identifiable packaging, known as a trade dress, can also be protected under trademark law."

          "What is the purpose of the mark? Trademarks and service marks protect the unique “brand” you have built for your unique good or service from being copied or used by others. Before seeking protection for a trademark or service mark, you must determine the types of goods or services for which you are trying to protect your mark. In making that determination, consider that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognizes a list of 45 international classifications of goods and services for which trademarks and service marks may apply, which cover everything from tools, musical instruments, foods, and textiles to advertising, sports organizations, technology services, and transportation. Protections for trademarks and service marks are limited only to those categories of products or services for which they are intended to apply."

          "May the mark be protected? Although you may develop what you consider to be the perfect mark to identify your products or services, not all marks are protectable under applicable law. Generally, one cannot seek trademark or service mark protection for common words, phrases, or images. For example, you cannot protect a phrase such as “thank you” or a generic image of a tree. However, trademarks or service marks may be applied to unique combinations of common words, phrases, or images. Generally speaking, the more unique and distinguishable a mark is, the greater levels of trademark protection it will garner. Before utilizing a trademark or service mark, it is also critical to conduct a thorough and diligent search to determine whether any substantially similar mark is already being used in commerce. If your desired mark is similar enough to another existing mark that it would likely create confusion among consumers as to the actual goods or services being offered or the source of those goods or services, your desired mark may infringe on the existing mark and should be reconsidered before pursuing protection."

          "Where is the mark protectable? Because goods and services are commonly available only in specific geographic markets, legal protections for trademarks and service marks are often controlled by the local markets in which the identified goods or services are sold. While the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) oversees all federal trademark regulations and registrations in the United States, trademarks and service marks receive certain common law protections without registration in the states in which the marks are used in commerce. In other words, if you are using a trademark or service mark for a good or service already in commerce in a specific city or state, and assuming your mark does not infringe on an existing mark in that particular market, you will receive certain limited, common law protections for your mark even without registration. However, such common law protections are limited only to that particular market and do not facilitate the protection of your brand identity outside of that market area."

          "Should the mark be registered? Although trademarks and service marks do not have to be registered to receive certain state common law protections, seeking state or federal registrations provides many advantages. First, registering trademarks creates a legal presumption of ownership of the marks and provides public notice of your marks. With a federal registration through the USPTO, a trademark or service mark may be protected throughout the United States, rather than only in a single state or market area. Additionally, unlike unregistered marks, a trademark owner may reserve protections for a trademark or service mark before it is actually used in commerce by assigning it an “intent to use” designation. Finally, if another entity were to infringe on an existing trademark or service mark, registration of the existing mark allows for the mark owner to recover statutory damages from the infringing entity in addition to actual damages resulting from the infringement."

In a typical termination agreement, the tenant agrees to pay the landlord some amount in exchange for the landlord’s agreement to release the tenant (and any guarantors) from all further obligations under the lease. The amount of the payment a landlord is willing to accept will necessarily depend upon the duration of the unexpired term of the lease and the landlord’s determination as to the likelihood that it can find a suitable replacement tenant. In a prime location in a hot market, where the landlord has the prospect of quickly bringing in a replacement tenant at what might even be a higher rent, the required termination payment is likely to be much less than it would be for space in a poor location or in a down market where the landlord expects it to be difficult to find a replacement tenant. Of course, the landlord’s assessment of the tenant’s financial ability to pay will also be a factor – sophisticated landlords recognize that there is no point in suing a tenant with no significant financial resources who may simply file bankruptcy."

In the best-case scenario, the lease will simply say that the tenant has the right to sublease or assign “subject to the landlord’s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.” Reasonable grounds for the landlord to withhold its consent would likely include the landlord’s good-faith determination that the substitute tenant does not have the ability to satisfy the financial obligations under the lease, or that the nature of the business of the substitute tenant is not appropriate for the particular location. Examples of the latter objection might include a landlord in a small retail center who does not want a marijuana dispensary as a substitute tenant, or who does not want to allow another shoe store in the center because it might harm the business of an existing shoe store already located in the center."

The assignment then creates a relationship directly between the landlord and the substitute tenant to the same extent as if the substitute tenant were the original tenant. As a result, the substitute tenant will deal directly with the landlord with respect to the payment of rent and the fulfillment of all other obligations under the lease. While this might suggest that the original tenant is then released from further liability under the lease, that is generally not the case. In practice, most leases contain language stating that even if the landlord approves the assignment, the original tenant will continue to remain liable for the payment of rent and the performance of all other obligations under the lease – such that the original tenant effectively becomes the “guarantor” of the obligations the substitute tenant has assumed."

Under the sublease, the substitute tenant is then required to pay rent to the original tenant (which may be less, more, or the same as the rent payable by the original tenant to the landlord), and the substitute tenant is generally required to perform all other obligations of the original tenant under the original lease. Note that if the rent that the substitute tenant has agreed to pay to the original tenant is less than the rent the original tenant is required to pay to the landlord, the original tenant will be required to pay the difference to the landlord in order to prevent a default under the original lease."

        "text": "The use of a sublease generally offers the original tenant several advantages over the use of an assignment (except in those very rare cases where a landlord agrees to release the original tenant from further liability in connection with the assignment). First, as mentioned above, the rent charged to the substitute tenant under a sublease need not be the same as the rent being charged to the original tenant under the lease. A tenant looking to unload its space and cut its losses may have greater luck finding a substitute tenant if the tenant can offer the space to the substitute tenant at a somewhat discounted rate. Second, since the original tenant will continue to be responsible for the payment of rent to the landlord in the case of a sublease, the failure of the substitute tenant to make its required rent payment to the original tenant will not cause a default under the original lease (although it may inflict some financial hardship on the original tenant). In contrast, with an assignment, the substitute tenant would be making rent payments directly to the landlord, such that the original tenant is unlikely to even be aware that a payment has been missed until the landlord has already declared a default. Lastly, since the sublease is an agreement directly between the original tenant and the substitute tenant, if the substitute tenant proves to be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations, the original tenant will have the right to evict the substitute tenant, retake possession and potentially re-lease the space to another substitute tenant, all without causing a default under the lease. However, under an assignment, since the substitute tenant becomes the direct tenant of the landlord, the tenant would have no ability to evict a noncompliant substitute tenant."

        "text": "It is important to remember that commercial leases are very different from residential leases. In the case of residential leases, there are various statutes and court-made rules that protect tenants from overzealous landlords and sometimes from tenants’ own poor judgment. However, few (if any) of these statutes and rules apply to commercial leases, where the courts will nearly always enforce the lease as written. As a result, the general discussion of a commercial tenant’s rights and obligations contained in this article may be superseded by the specific provisions of a particular lease. A tenant looking to vacate its space prior to the end of the lease term, and to minimize liability for its remaining obligations under its lease, will be well-advised to seek the advice of legal counsel experienced in leasing matters."

FAQ #46 provides that if the SBA does conduct a review of such a loan and finds that a borrower lacked adequate basis for the required certification, the SBA will seek repayment of the PPP Loan and notify the bank that the borrower is not eligible for loan forgiveness. Providing some relief to borrowers of PPP Loans over $2 million, FAQ #46 does provide that “if the borrower repays the loan [PPP Loan] after receiving notification from the SBA, SBA will not pursue administrative enforcement or referrals to other agencies based on its determination with respect to the certification concerning necessity.”"

In addition to making a showing as of the time the loan application was made, it may be helpful to demonstrate the need continued on an ongoing basis, including presently (while the business was considering whether to return the PPL Loan before the May 14 deadline). Generally, a borrower who does not meet the safe harbor should be working with their advisers (be it their accountant, banker, or attorney) to assist with documenting necessity of the PPP Loan."

Zollinger signed three agreements as part of these deals: 1) an asset purchase agreement governing the sale of his original employer to the new company; 2) an operating agreement as part of his ownership in the new company; and 3) an employment agreement as a condition of employment with the new company.

The company moved for summary judgement and was successful. The trial court ordered Zollinger to comply with the restrictions. After the summary judgment order, the company amended its complaint to add a claim of breach of contract because Zollinger was performing consulting work for a competitor. After a bench trial, the trial court concluded that Zollinger’s work for the competitor violated both the operating and the employment agreements.

In typical employment contracts, the covenants are reviewed under a “skeptical” standard, but covenants that arise in relation to the sale of a business are subject to a more “liberal” standard. The court determined that the more liberal standard would be applied to Zollinger because the agreements were part of the sale of a business. The court appeared to be less persuaded by Zollinger’s arguments as a result of the significant amount of money he made, his long-standing ownership interests and his status as a “sophisticated businessman.”"

The court then went into a lengthy discussion of the similarities between the company and the competitor and the overlap of the work Zollinger performed for the two companies. There was a laundry list of activities that Zollinger performed for the competitor that he had previously performed for the company.

Executive Order 20-02[1] was issued pursuant to the Governor’s authority under Indiana’s Emergency Management and Disaster Law (the “EMDL”). Ind. Code ch. 10-14-3 et seq. Pursuant to the authority granted to the Governor under the EMDL, subsequent Orders were issued which temporarily prohibited evictions and foreclosures (Executive Order 20-06), rescheduled Indiana’s primary elections (Executive Order 20-07) and directed Hoosiers to “Stay at Home” (Executive Order 20-08). In addition to these Orders, Governor Holcomb’s declaration of a public health emergency under the EMDL also triggered potential immunity for health-care providers who are providing health-care services in response to the COVID-19 emergency. This article will explore the immunity provisions triggered by EMDL and address how those provisions may apply to health-care facilities and individuals.",

Ind. Model Civ. Jury Inst. 913. Wanton or willful conduct consists of either: (1) an intentional act done with reckless disregard of the natural and probable consequence of injury to a known person under the circumstances known to the actor at the time; or (2) an omission or failure to act when the actor has actual knowledge of the natural and probable consequence of injury and has opportunity to avoid that risk.

This could become a particular point of contention in wrongful death claim where the primary cause of death is not declared to be COVID-19 but where COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing cause of death. Likewise, while there appears to be absolute immunity for “facilities” and “locations”, a Plaintiff can still bring forth a claim against individual health-care providers if they can show the individual acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct. Thus, cases normally brought only against certain facilities such as hospitals or nursing homes may instead now be brought against the individual providers within those facilities to avoid the facilities’ defense of absolute immunity."

A cashier who is subject to a stay-at-home order would not be able to work even if he were not required to stay home because the shop no longer has any work for its employees.

The key to any successful defense is to have a plan and be agile enough to respond to the tactics of the opposing party.

For instance, a medical malpractice claim may last 2 – 10 years from inception to conclusion. If a party wakes up every morning worried about their case, such stress will become overwhelming and detrimental to their health. While complete disinterest is not advisable either, a healthy balance of planning and patience will pay off in the long run."

Despite just being passed, the CARES Act has been in the public eye for the past couple of weeks and has been referred to as “Phase III” in the relief packages. The Act is approximately 880 pages in length and has broad-sweeping provisions that provide massive amounts of support for individuals and for businesses large and small; it also provides targeted relief and benefits for the largest businesses, public sector, government and certain specified industries. The CARES Act also provides the $1,200 per taxpayer and $500 per child payments you have heard about for eligible taxpayers."

It appears that the lender or SBA will calculate the “expected forgiveness amount” in advance. This provision also promotes the desired effect of inducing employers to keep or rehire employees during that entire 8-week period and after to maximize the amount eligible for forgiveness."

The amount cannot exceed the principal amount of the loan and it will be reduced if there is a reduction in number of employees by the business during the covered period. Notably, there are requirements for submitting documentation (described in the Act) after the loan is obtained and after the 8-week period. The lender will then verify the business meets the requirement for forgiveness of any part of the loan and determine the actual amount. Although forgiveness of debt is typically taxable as income, any amount forgiven is specifically excluded under the CARES Act from the gross income of the business. The SBA will, within 30 days, issue guidance and regulations to implement this section of the Act. We plan to report on any further guidance issued by the SBA as it is given."

That way, your attorney can be more productive with written discovery requests and responses, thoroughly prepare witnesses for depositions on all the relevant issues, and take better depositions of witnesses for the other parties."

While some attorneys wait to exchange exhibits for trial until just weeks or days before trial as parties are preparing their trial notebooks, if an important document or testimony falls outside what is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, it can be too late to find other evidence that would be admissible and prove the same point. To avoid that, your attorney should take time to review the Rules of Evidence periodically. He or she should also consider the material evidence being developed in your case as the case proceeds and evaluate whether it will be admissible so that if it will not, your attorney can consider what other evidence might prove that point and obtain it before the discovery deadline."

The new rules, which will apply prospectively to new leases entered after the rules take effect and to leases already on the books, will have the effect of moving most leases to the lessee’s balance sheet. As a result, prudent lessees will need to decide whether to structure their new leases as “finance leases”[3] or “operating leases,” depending on the accounting-related advantages they wish to capture.[4] In so deciding, lessees should consider the legal rights and responsibilities associated with each structure.",

If, however, the lease is a disguised sale, the lessee’s creditors could potentially perfect a security interest in the “leased” property, to the detriment of the lessor. Additionally, while the lessor has the right to repossess the property upon default in either case,[7] if the lease is deemed a secured transaction, the lessor must dispose of the collateral in strict accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”).[8] The potential concerns reach beyond the provisions of the UCC. For example, in an Indiana tax case, an entity that believed it had created sales with security interests in its contracts was penalized by the state for not including the property in its personal property tax return after the court determined the contracts were actually true leases.[9] This issue also comes up with frequency in bankruptcy courts because leases and security agreements are treated differently in the Bankruptcy Code.[10]",

Before a contractor can exercise contractual rights, it must know what those rights are and how to trigger them, which cannot be known without reading the contract beforehand. I often jokingly tell contractors that they should read their contracts “slowly, and with feeling,” but at a minimum, they should read their contracts with anticipation, asking themselves various “what…if” questions as they read, such as: “What rights do I have if my schedule is compressed? What do I do if my subcontractor isn’t properly staffing the project?” Asking these types of questions can help focus reading through page after page of legalese."

        "text": "2. Project Managers don’t timely give notice. Of all of the consequences of a failure to read the contracts at the beginning of the project, this is perhaps the most common. A typical example: many subcontracts contain clauses that require that the subcontractor give the general contractor timely notice of delay, and in the absence of such notice, the subcontractor loses its right to make claims for time and/or money based on that delay. Such clauses—called “traps”—are generally enforceable, and there is little that a subcontractor can do after the fact to resurrect a claim that is lost because of a failure to give timely notice."

With each payment application, a contractor is commonly required to submit a lien waiver in which the contractor (a) attests that, for the time period covered by the application, the contractor is owed only the amount shown on the pay application, and (b) releases all other claims for compensation for work performed during that time period. If a contractor has a claim that it wishes to preserve arising out of the time period covered by a payment application, the contractor should note that claim as an exception on the lien waiver(s) for that payment application. Otherwise, the contractor risks waiving that claim."

Subcontracts frequently state that the subcontractor is not entitled to payment for work outside the original scope without a signed change order for the extra work. Often, in the middle of projects they are hustling to complete on schedule, subcontractors rely on oral promises by the general contractors that a change order will be issued, only to be surprised later when (a) the change order is not signed and (b) they read the contract, which states that a signed change order is necessary to be paid for extra work. Such clauses are frequently enforced by courts."

I have filed scores of mechanic’s liens and payment bond claims for my clients, in amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to in excess of $10 million, and I have yet to encounter a client who is excited about taking that step. But mechanic’s liens (for private projects) and payment bond claims (for public projects) are important remedies for subcontractors to preserve, because they serve two purposes: (a) they provide another source of payment (other than the general contractor) and (b) they involve interested third parties (the owner, in case of a mechanic’s lien, and a surety, in the case of a payment bond claim) who may be able to assist resolving the dispute."

(Different rules apply for work on residential projects.) On Indiana public projects, the deadlines for filing a payment bond claim differ depending on who the owner is, but generally speaking, those deadlines are tied to the subcontractor’s last date of work onsite. In addition, to preserve the payment bond claim, the subcontractor must timely file a lawsuit in court on the payment bond claim, the deadline for which depends (again) on who the owner is, and is generally tied to the date of the owner’s final acceptance of the project."

Wetzel involved the claim of Marsha Wetzel, an openly gay female who lived at Glen St. Andrew Living Community (“St. Andrew”), a residential community for older adults. Shortly after moving to St. Andrew, Wetzel had allegedly been openly and repeatedly harassed by other residents because of her sexual orientation.

The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Wetzel appealed, and the matter came before the Seventh Circuit. Id."

To prove a hostile housing environment claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) he/she endured unwelcome harassment based on a protected characteristic; (2) the harassment was severe or pervasive enough to interfere with the terms, conditions, or privileges of her residency, or in the provision of services or facilities; and (3) that there is a basis for imputing liability to the defendant.

The Court found most analogous the United States Supreme Court’s treatment of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 645 (1999), in which the Supreme Court held that a school district could be held liable for failing to respond when one of the students under its authority had engaged in known acts of student-on-student sexual harassment, since the school district “exercised substantial control over both the harasser and the premises on which the misconduct took place.”"

Indiana, like most states, has enacted its own version of the Fair Housing Act, codified at Ind. Code §§ 22–9.5–1–1 et seq. Though not identical to the federal Fair Housing Act, the Indiana Fair Housing Act “borrows heavily” from it, specifically stating that its purpose is to “provide rights and remedies substantially equivalent to those granted under federal law.” Ind. Code § 22-9.5-1-1. Indiana’s courts “look to federal case law for guidance” when interpreting Indiana’s civil rights statutes and generally do not interpret the state’s civil rights laws more narrowly than their federal counterparts. Thus, Indiana state courts, if given the opportunity, will likely find that a cause of action exists for hostile housing environment under the Indiana Fair Housing Act. State, Civil Rights Comm’n v. Cnty. Line Park, Inc., 738 N.E.2d 1044, 1048 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000) (citing Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Alder, 714 N.E.2d 632, 636 (Ind. 1999)).

Your Will or Revocable Trust can establish trusts for your minor or adult children with a trustee of your choice. A trust allows you to control the conditions upon which your children receive the property you leave them and avoids leaving money or other assets to your children (regardless of age) if they are not ready or capable of managing such assets on their own. A trust can also be used to avoid issues created by leaving money to a minor (including the need for a court to appoint a financial guardian with cumbersome and often expensive court reporting requirements) and to provide for a child until he or she receives his or her inheritance at an age selected by you (at least 18 and often older). Proper planning also allows you to document the person(s) who will be appointed to raise your minor children. Without such a designation, one or more family members may file and pursue (and fight over) being appointed guardian over you’re your minor children."

If you do not have a Will or Revocable Trust, however, your surviving spouse is unlikely to receive all of your individually-owned assets. For example, in Indiana, if you die without children but at least one of your parents survives you, your spouse will only receive a portion (likely 75%) of your individually-owned assets, with the remainder going to your parents. Or, if you die with children, there will be a split of individually-owned assets between your surviving spouse and your children (regardless of age). Unmarried couples will generally not receive any of the assets of the first of them to die which are individually owned and even some that are jointly owned, making planning a necessity for those couples. Planning for spouses, partners, or significant others can avoid these unintended results."

For couples in these marriages, especially those where children are involved, estate planning is even more critical. These couples must consider and find a balance that addresses the often competing interests of taking care of a surviving spouse while ensuring that any children of the first-to-die spouse have been provided for adequately. Without proper planning, all assets of one spouse could pass to the surviving spouse who could, intentionally or even unintentionally, leave those assets to only the survivor’s children and/or a new spouse upon their death, with nothing going to the children or family of the first spouse to die. Planning in these situations often involves some combination of a trust, life insurance, and other planning tools that ensure the surviving spouse, all children involved, and other family members of each spouse are provided for in the manner that the couple chooses."

This lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion, which will adjust for inflation until it sunsets in 2025 (unless extended by Congress) is in addition to the unlimited marital deduction, which allows you to leave an unlimited amount of property to your surviving spouse tax free, and the annual gift tax exclusion, which in 2019 enables you to give up to $15,000 per recipient of your choice."

For tax determination purposes, the calculation of one’s gross estate generally includes the value of beneficiary-designated assets such as life insurance policies and retirement accounts. Many clients are surprised by this, especially concerning life insurance proceeds, an asset generally understood to be ”non-taxable”, which is likely true with respect to income taxes but not for establishing the amount of your gross estate subject to gift and estate tax. Aside from the total value of an individual’s assets, there are other issues, such as specific types of assets, which may require tax-specific planning or consideration an essential part of your estate plan."

Business succession planning addresses whether family members or others, such as business partners or employees, will own or run the business after the owner’s death. These succession planning considerations bring their own dynamics and challenges, which are particularly difficult when deciding which family members to involve in the future ownership and operation of a company. Generally, the current owners know what is best for the future of the company. Lack of a succession plan can result in significant adverse consequences for both the business and family after the owner’s death, including disputes, unfairness (among children, for example), loss of business value, unintended tax consequences, or even failure of the business. A significant number of businesses do not make it to or through a second (or later) generation, and failure of the current ownership to plan will almost certainly increase that likelihood."

Another type of advanced directive is a living will, which expresses your wishes as to the use or continued use of life-prolonging measures.

In order to use the scooter, the user installs an app on his or her phone, supplies credit card or other payment information and accepts the scooter contract. The user scans the code on the scooter, which begins the trip. To end the trip, the user parks the scooter then ends the ride through the app. The price of the trip is withdrawn from the user’s credit card or other electronic payment methods. The companies have similar contracts (“the standard contract”) containing similar disclaimer and risk transfer provisions that attempt to absolve the companies from liability for injuries to the user or others, require arbitration of disputes, and prohibit class action complaints."

These provisions also state that the user releases the company, its employees’ contractors and the municipality in which the scooter is being used from liability for all claims arising from, or related to, the user’s use of the company’s services and equipment. Accordingly, if the user agrees to the standard contract, which he or she must do in order to use the scooter, he or she is agreeing that if he or she is injured by using the scooter (even if the injuries arise from the negligence or fault of the company in failing to provide a safe scooter), he or she has released any right to recover from the company for those injuries."

If a scooter user rides a scooter every day to go to and from his or her apartment to work, and the scooter or a similar scooter in the “fleet” of the companies’ scooters is regularly available on the sidewalk near the user’s apartment, the scooter is arguably available for regular use such that liability while using it is also excluded under this or a similar exclusion.

Homeowner’s and renter’s policies may provide limited coverage for some motor vehicles such as motor vehicles designed for recreational use off public roads, or golf carts when used on the premises of the insured home, on golf courses, or on the streets of a private residential community where the insured’s residence is located and where golf carts are allowed. In Indianapolis, scooters are specifically required to be operated on city streets and not on sidewalks, so it may be difficult to argue that they should be covered as “recreational vehicles designed for use off public roads.”[4] Accordingly, a scooter would not likely fall within the coverage for golf carts and certain off-road vehicles. Of course, there are many variations in homeowner’s policies regarding the types of motor vehicles that are not included in the motor vehicle exclusion, and there may be some homeowner’s policy forms that would cover liability for damages and injuries arising from the use of an electric scooter.

While patrons are not required to be residents or citizens of Indiana, the online or mobile device used to place the bet must be located within the borders of the State.[vii] Of course, then the question becomes: how does the website determine whether a patron is in Indiana? The answer, while technologically complicated, is quite simple. These online and mobile apps utilize software that incorporates state-of-the-art “geofencing” technology, which can track the location of a patron’s device through a GPS-satellite signal. The “geofencing” system is programmed to monitor the patron’s location continually while the website or mobile app is in use and to block attempts to access the online sportsbook if the device is outside the confines of the Hoosier state.[viii] Once the website or device verifies that the patron is in Indiana, the he or she can successfully place the online wager.",

While the bylaws of the NCAA (the governing body of collegiate athletics) prohibit student-athletes from participating in sports gambling of any kind, these regulations do not apply to every student or university employee. As a result, Purdue University’s Board of Trustees opted for internal policies in response to legalization because “[legalized sports gambling] did not feel consistent with a value set that we think we hold onto[.]”[ix] Regardless of the stringency of the ban, Purdue University President, (and former Indiana governor) Mitch Daniels, acknowledged it would be difficult to truly enforce. “We’re not going to set up a secret police to run around and try to find out,” Daniels said.[x]",

If faculty or staff are members of unions, this type of regulation may be within the realm of activities considered part of “working conditions.”[xi] Because the negotiation of terms surrounding working conditions is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, the argument can be made that the policy must be mutually agreed upon between the university and the union before enactment, which does not appear to be the case here. Further, for non-unionized workers at Purdue University, this policy could be interpreted as a new contractual term that would require a new agreement with the employee, although Purdue may have arguments that the policy falls within the purview of a morals clause in certain employment contracts that would not require faculty and staff approval.[xii]",

Currently, Indiana is in a unique geographic and economic position because the nearby, traditionally larger sports markets have not yet legalized sports gambling. Ohio, Michigan, and Kentucky are significantly behind in passing and enacting legislation; however, Illinois – where a noteworthy percentage of the patrons to Indiana’s northern-most casinos reside – is quickly closing the gap. Illinois governor, J.B. Pritzker, signed a sports-betting law into effect in June 2019, and while the Illinois Gaming Board has yet to authorize a sportsbook, casinos, racetracks, and stadiums can begin applying for licenses in December 2019.[xiii] According to the Illinois Gaming Board, applications for sportsbook operators will become available as soon as December 19, 2019.[xiv] However, Indiana caught a break when Illinois mandated that mobile-only licenses cannot be applied for until 18 months after sports betting goes fully live in Illinois.[xv] Based on this, it will likely be 2022 before Indiana experiences significant competition in online sports betting at its borders.",

However, in recent years, many current and former student-athletes have fought to be paid for their athletic participation and for the use of their likenesses based on the massive revenues generated by major intercollegiate sporting events. In furtherance of student-athletes’ position, the California state legislature recently passed the “Fair Pay to Play Act,” allowing student-athletes at California colleges and universities to receive compensation for use of their names, images, and likenesses in connection with their participation in intercollegiate athletics beginning in 2023. Nine other states are also considering similar legislation, and members of Congress have similarly proposed federal legislation on student-athlete compensation. This article explores the recently enacted and proposed legislation, the conflict such legislation presents with NCAA bylaws, and the impact these new and proposed laws could have on intercollegiate athletics going forward."

WTHR reported that on August 7, 2019, a student with a gun was stopped near Muncie Central High School; on August 8, a loaded gun was found in an Arsenal Tech student’s backpack; on August 15, police say a gun was found in the book bag of a Lawrence Central student; and on August 20, a student with a gun was stopped at North Central High School and a student with a gun was arrested at Ben Davis High School. As WTHR further noted, this comes after two Indiana shootings occurred at Noblesville West Middle School and Dennis Intermediate School in Richmond in 2018. In response to these school shootings, WTHR reports that Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb made a plan available to schools in which the State provided one handheld metal detector for every 250 students at any school that requested the devices. (Rich Nye, “Are state issued metal detectors being used by the schools that received them?” WTHR Aug. 22, 2019, 3:16 p.m.) https://www.wthr.com/article/are-state-issued-metal-detectors-being-used-schools-received-them",

I.C. § 20-34-3-20. Additionally, each Indiana school corporation is required to develop a written emergency preparedness plan for the school corporation and each school in the corporation. At a minimum, these plans must contain: (1) appropriate warning systems; (2) procedures for notifying other agencies and organizations; (3) posting of evacuation routes; (4) emergency preparedness instruction for staff and students; (5) public information procedures; (6) steps that will be taken prior to a decision to evacuate buildings or dismiss classes; and (7) provisions to protect the safety and well-being of staff, students, and the public including from man-made occurrences, or student disturbances, weapons, weapons of mass destruction, contamination of the water or air supply, and hostage or kidnapping incidents. 511 I.A.C. 6.1-2-5."

Each school safety committee is also required to provide a copy of floor plans for each building located on the school’s property to local law enforcement agencies and the fire department having jurisdiction over the school. Guidelines developed by the Indiana Department of Education to assist schools in preparing their plans must include age appropriate, research-based information that assists school corporations and safe school committees in developing and implementing bullying prevention programs, establishing investigation and reporting procedures relating to bullying, and adopting discipline rules.

I.C. § 20-28-5-3. Additionally, each school corporation is required to train school employees who are likely to have direct, ongoing contact with children on the duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect and on recognizing the signs of child abuse or neglect at least once every two years. I.C. § 20-28-3-4.5. Also, each school corporation must require that all teachers who are employed at schools that provide instruction to students in any combination of grades 5-12 attend or participate in at least two hours of youth suicide awareness and prevention training every three school years."

Having three school-aged children, school safety is a big area of concern for me.

Thus, while a creditor of a corporation or an LLC can obtain a court order seizing assets owned by the company itself (such as the company’s inventory, equipment, accounts receivable and the cash in the company’s bank accounts) in order to satisfy a liability of the company to that creditor, creditors generally cannot seize assets that belong to the company’s owners (such as their homes and cars and the cash in their personal bank accounts). In contrast, the owners of a company operated as a sole proprietorship or a general partnership do not have this protection, meaning that creditors of the business can potentially seize both the assets of the business and the owners’ personal assets to satisfy a liability of the business.",

Some examples of tort liability include a company’s liability for injuries sustained by a customer who slips on a loose rug in the company’s reception area, a traffic accident caused by an employee while driving to a customer’s office, an injury or loss sustained by a customer from the negligent design of a product manufactured by the company, or a loss sustained by a customer as a result of the company’s negligence in providing a service."

          "Personal guaranties. Unfortunately for small business owners, most creditors weren’t born yesterday. They are well-aware that people choose to operate their businesses as corporations or LLCs for the specific purpose of preventing the owners from being liable for amounts owed to the creditors. As a result, sophisticated creditors – most notably banks and landlords – will almost always require the owner of a small business operating as a corporation or an LLC to sign a “personal guaranty.” By executing a personal guaranty, the owner is waiving her limited liability with respect to the company’s debt to that particular creditor and is agreeing that the creditor will have the right to seize her personal assets if necessary to obtain payment of that debt. In situations where an owner is forced to sign a personal guaranty in connection with a specific transaction, the savvy owner will attempt to include language in the guaranty that limits either or both the maximum amount for which the owner will be personally liable under the guaranty, or the duration of the guaranty (such that, for example, the guaranty might expire after a year or two once the business has established a good credit history with the creditor). Beware: Many unscrupulous vendors (including some credit card companies) conceal personal guaranties in the “fine print” of their customer agreements, stating that the person signing the form is expressly agreeing to be personally liable, along with the company, for all amounts owed to the creditor.",
          "Negligence or misconduct by the owner. Both the Indiana corporations statute and the Indiana LLC statute (cited in footnote 1) expressly provide that while an owner is not generally liable for the liabilities of the company, that limitation does not protect an owner from liability for the owner’s own acts or omissions. For example, where the owner of an excavation business operating as an LLC personally operates a backhoe that ruptures a gas line and causes an explosion, the owner will be personally liable for the damage caused by the explosion, as will his LLC. Note that the laws applicable to many professions also provide that a professional who operates his business in the form of a corporation or LLC may not limit his liability for his own acts and omissions. [2]",
          "Failure to identify as a corporation or an LLC. A creditor dealing with a corporation or an LLC is presumed to know the law and is presumed to know that the owners of the company will not be personally liable for the debts of the company (unless the owners provide personal guaranties). However, the owner of a company may have personal liability if the creditor is not aware that the company is a corporation or an LLC. For this reason, it is imperative that all of a company’s contracts use the full name of the company (for example, “Acme Industries, LLC” not merely “Acme Industries”), and the person signing any company contract must specifically reference his position with the company as part of his signature (for example, “John Jones, President” or “John Jones, Manager,” and not merely “John Jones”). It is also important that a company include its full name on its stationery, its business cards and its website to give customers and vendors notice of its status as a corporation or an LLC.",
          "Personal liability imposed by statute. There are various federal and state laws that specifically impose personal liability on a business owner (and other company officers) for certain liabilities. For example, personal liability can be imposed for the failure to collect and remit payroll withholding taxes to the Internal Revenue Service.[3] Additionally, owners may be personally liable for negligence or other misconduct relating to employee benefit plans that they control, such as where they collect but fail to remit employee contributions to a health insurance plan or 401(k) plan, or where they misuse or mismanage the assets of an employee retirement plan.[4]",
          "“Piercing the corporate veil.” There are certain circumstances where either the neglect or misconduct of the owners will result in a court concluding that a company’s status as a corporation or an LLC should simply be disregarded and that the owners should be personally liable for some or all of the liabilities of the company. A court’s decision to disregard a company’s status as a corporation or an LLC is commonly referred to as “piercing the corporate veil.” The Indiana courts have ruled that the corporate veil can be pierced and personal liability imposed on the owners where the creditor has proven that the owners have failed to treat the company as something separate from themselves, and their misuse of the company would constitute fraud or otherwise promote injustice.[5]Simply stated, if the company hasn’t been operated like a corporation or an LLC, the court may elect not to treat it as a corporation or an LLC. Some of the specific factors the courts will examine when determining whether to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability on the owners include the following: (i) undercapitalization; (ii) the failure to maintain required business records; (iii) fraudulent representations by the owners, managers or directors; (iv) use of the company for fraudulent, illegal or unjust activities; (v) payment by the company of the owners’ personal obligations (for example, using the company checking account to pay the owners’ personal credit card bills); (vi) commingling of the assets and affairs of the company and its owners (for example, failing to maintain company bank accounts separate from the owners’ personal bank accounts); (vii) failure to observe the required formalities for the corporation or the LLC (for example, failing to hold required meetings or to take votes on matters requiring a vote); and (viii) other conduct “ignoring, controlling, or manipulating” the status of the company as a business separate from the owners.[6]",
          "Improper distributions to owners. Both corporations[7] and limited liability companies[8] are prohibited by law from making distributions to their owners if, following the distribution: (i) the company would be unable to pay its debts when due; or (ii) the amount of the company’s liabilities would exceed the value of its assets. If distributions are made to owners in violation of these rules, the owners will be subject to suit by creditors of the company to recoup the amount of these improper distributions. In the case of a company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy laws will also allow these improper distributions to be recouped by the bankruptcy estate. Note that in the case of improper distributions, the owners are not actually being held personally liable for a debt of the corporation. Rather, the owners are simply being required to give up the distributions that should not have been made to them."

Creditors are better off to settle pre-bankruptcy and have the settlement proceeds in their hand while later, if necessary, negotiating what must be returned to the bankruptcy estate. A settled preference or fraudulent conveyance claim will most often result in the creditor keeping a more significant percentage of an unsecured debt than not settling and merely taking what the creditor gets from submitting its proof of claim."

It is important to acknowledge that the bankruptcy stay under 11 U.S.C. § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes a “super stay” against any activity that could detract from a debtor attending to its bankruptcy or that might otherwise dissipate assets of the bankruptcy estate. A creditor is precluded from among other activities: 1) commencing or continuing an action or proceeding against a debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case; 2) enforcing a judgment obtained before the commencement of the bankruptcy case; 3) taking action to obtain possession of property of the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate; 4) taking action to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against the estate; 5) taking action to create, perfect, or enforce against property of the debtor any lien to the extent the lien secures a claim that arose before commencement of the bankruptcy case; 6) taking action to collect, assess or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before commencement of the bankruptcy case; 7) setting off of any debt owing to the debtor that arose before commencement of the bankruptcy case against any claim against the debtor; and 8) commencing or continuing a proceeding before the United States Tax Court concerning the debtor. The automatic stay is activated immediately on the filing of a voluntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code, and remains in effect until the entry of an order granting or denying a discharge or closing or dismissing the . . . case, or until the entry of an order granting relief from the stay; however that does not mean that a creditor is precluded from ceasing all activity that affects the debtor.

Effectively using specific strategies prior to and during bankruptcy can often serve to place the creditor in a better position than had it walked away from claims because of the bankruptcy filing. Indeed, bankruptcy can be an effective tool for creditors to obtain closure and assure themselves that a debtor is playing straight and properly disclosing its assets and liabilities. Once a bankruptcy notice is received, proactive creditors will determine how to use the bankruptcy filing to their advantage and will not just lie back and wait for the eventual notice of discharge."

Capping damages would, in theory, result in lower health care costs, allowing greater access to healthcare, as well as improve the quality of health care in the state as the best and brightest physicians would be drawn and retained, in part because the cost of their malpractice insurance was low."

Part of this process involves the collection of data to determine the statewide median premiums collected by the three malpractice insurance carriers who have underwritten the most malpractice insurance policies for physicians.

Even the earliest claims under the most recent cap increase, (i.e. claims that occurred on July 1, 2017) are still not time barred. In addition, while the recent changes to the MMA stress the importance of moving through the process quickly through a more strict adherence to deadlines imposed by the MMA and the Medical Review Panel Chairperson, (See, I.C. § 34-18-0.5-1 “Adherence to timelines”), many cases that qualify for the July 1, 2017 increased damage caps, most likely have not progressed to the point of settlement or judgment whereby the PCF has begun to pay out its increased limits. All of this is promising information for healthcare providers in Indiana. To date, the increased caps on damages available to patient’s under the MMA have not resulted in a significant increase in premiums or surcharge rates charged to the providers. While it is still early in the process from a litigation standpoint, there is new hope that the increased damage caps will not have a significant negative effect on the cost of insurance."

        "text": "An injury, accident, or illness can leave a family member or loved one incapable of making decisions, self-care, or helping those for whom they are responsible, such as minor children. The extent, duration, and nature of a person’s incapacity varies significantly in each circumstance; from a broken leg that leaves a single mother unable to care for her minor children for a few days, to a severe stroke that requires long-term around-the-clock care for its victim. During any periods in which an individual is determined to be disabled, incapacitated, or incapable of managing his or her affairs, Indiana law establishes the priority and extent to which others can act on behalf of that person, unless an effective document designating an appointed representative has been executed in advance."

        "text": "People often execute documents for use in the event of their incapacity because the priority and extent to which others are authorized to act in Indiana in the absence of these documents are inconsistent with their wishes, values, beliefs, or family circumstances. Some people who execute these documents are aware their incapacity is imminent and others do so to prepare for the unexpected. Regardless of the reason they are entered, these documents serve as a source of comfort to them by ensuring that their family and loved ones know their wishes and can carry them out if (or when) they are unable to do so."

        "text": "Documents used to plan for incapacity are often executed in conjunction with other estate planning documents, such as wills and trusts. People do, however, execute powers-of-attorney and health care directives alone. For example, many college-age children execute only these documents to ensure that their parents or other trusted adults can assist them with their financial affairs and health care matters if circumstances ever require such assistance. This article discusses what documents are routinely used to plan for a Hoosier’s incapacity."

A designation of health care representative gives a willing and available named representative or representatives (if more than one is named) the priority to act and make health care decisions for an incapacitated person in the manner authorized by that document until the injured person is capable of consenting to health care.[3] If your loved one executed a document designating a health care representative, a copy of that document should be given to the named health care representative and to the health care providers that are being requested to rely on the authority granted to the health care representative. That document may allow the health care representative to delegate his or her authority if they are not available for a period of time.[4] The ability to delegate the health care representative’s authority may be necessary if, for example, the named health care representative is out of town when your loved one’s accident occurs.",

If this situation arises, a copy of the declaration should be provided to your loved one’s attending physician.[8]",

Persons together or the person (if only one) responsible for others, including minor children and protected persons over whom they are guardian, may also execute a declaration of standby guardian to appoint a person as temporary guardian over those minors and protected persons after their death or incapacity for a period of time, or until a permanent guardian can be put in place.[13] These declarations can be particularly important for loved ones who either do not have or would otherwise not be able to rely on those otherwise granted such authority under Indiana law.",

In such event, a power-of-attorney may name a person or persons whom your loved one desired to serve as guardian of his or her person and estate. A court will generally appoint a person nominated as guardian in a person’s most recent power-of-attorney unless good cause is shown or the nominated person is disqualified as a guardian.[14] The person or persons nominated to serve as guardian in a power-of-attorney need not be the same as the attorney-in-fact. However, a guardian’s powers are governed by the Indiana Probate Code, which does not confer as expansive authority to a guardian as those that may be granted to an attorney-in-fact under a general power-of-attorney.[15] Therefore, if the nominated person is not also the attorney-in-fact, there could be no or limited need for a guardian. Similarly, for those individuals whose assets are primarily held in trust or with competent spouses who own assets jointly, there could be no or limited need for a guardian because the trustee under the terms of the trust or spouse by operation of law, has the same or greater powers to act than could be granted to a guardian under the Indiana Probate Code.",

This rule plays hand-in-hand with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits any state from depriving any person (including a corporation) from any property (including money) “without due process of law.” Courts have held that “due process” requires that, before a court may exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, the defendant must have sufficient minimum contacts with the state so that it would not be unfair or unjust for the defendant to be sued in that state."

Facts which supported the existence of personal jurisdiction included: (1) the defendants solicited the plaintiff in Indiana to sell the plaintiff’s restaurants; (2) the sale contract was an agreement requiring the defendants to make payments to the plaintiff in Indiana; and (3) after the contract was executed the defendants maintained business relationships with Indiana companies and residents and maintained a mailbox in Indiana."

The only deliberate contacts the defendant had with Indiana were limited to general advertising, emailing a form contract to the plaintiff at the plaintiff’s request, and invoicing and receiving payment from the plaintiff.

AI does not have a precise definition, but most commonly accepted definitions include the connection between a complex function requiring human intelligence being performed by an automated computer algorithm. In other words, an AI algorithm is a very sophisticated computer program that is continually being refined, updated and improved (i.e., the program itself is capable of learning). Automation, however, is generally considered a very basic version of the same AI theories. While machines have been replacing human production for hundreds of years, AI has accelerated the issue and threatened jobs once considered safe from technology advancements. Polls have consistently shown that most Americans believe it is likely that technology (whether through automation or AI) will replace most jobs currently done by humans. However, the same polls have found that most Americans believe their jobs are safe from automation. Not surprisingly, the responses to such polls generally correlate to income level (with lower-paid occupations being more susceptible to automation and higher income individuals more likely to believe their jobs are safe). While such predictions are generally supported by human history, AI is changing historical norms and threatening occupations once considered safe."

        "text": "Driverless cars are a good example of recent technology advancements. While driving is generally considered a low-skill occupation, driving safely is difficult. In the United States, there are approximately 6 million traffic accidents each year. This equates to 11 accidents every minute of every day. While there are all sorts of reasons vehicle accidents occur (other than unsafe driving), it seems reasonable to conclude that safe driving is a difficult skill to master, making safe driving a relatively complex activity. However, driverless cars are here. Approximately 21 states have passed legislation regarding regulation of driverless cars. Indiana was slated to become the 22nd state (which coincides with former Chief Justice Randall Shepard’s quote about Indiana’s legal reform being “rarely first, occasionally last, and frequently early”). However, the legislation could not make it over the finish line during the 2018 legislative session. While the technology allowing driverless vehicles has been around for years, the AI aspect of driverless cars is infinitely more complicated. For instance, when a driverless car detects an accident in the immediate vicinity, the car quickly calculates whether it should swerve to avoid the accident (causing possible injury to bystanders), or whether it should engage the braking system in hopes the airbag system will protect the passengers (i.e., the passenger vs. pedestrian dilemma). Likewise, a driverless vehicle must be able to decide between difficult moral decisions, such as swerving and hitting a pedestrian who is jaywalking vs. hitting a child walking on the sidewalk (i.e., the child vs. criminal dilemma). Such decisions are complicated moral decisions that must be integrated into an AI algorithm. Anyone who understands this current state of complex technology will likely admit that jobs involving similarly complex decision making — once considered safe from automation or technology — are no longer safe. In other words, if we can program a car to make split-second moral decisions, we can certainly create a computer program to draft or analyze a legal document."

        "text": "For decades, lawyers had a false sense of security that they were safe from technological automation because their work involved complex decision-making and creative problem-solving that a computer algorithm could never match. Lawyers were also successful in protecting their profession from outsiders (both AI as well as highly skilled nonlawyers) via unlicensed practice of law statutes and other monopolistic protections. Finally, law firms structured around the concept of the billable hour are historically slow to adopt (and have competing incentives not to adopt) time-saving technologies, including AI. Despite these factors, legal AI has developed in areas including automated contract review (computer programs that review contracts for predefined clauses that have been previously approved by a party and analyze/flag potentially problematic language in contracts). One recent study of such platforms involved the ability to flag potential legal risks in five nondisclosure agreements. An AI system had an accuracy rate of 94 percent (not perfect, but pretty good). The same task was completed by 20 experienced transactional lawyers from large national law firms who had an average accuracy rate of 85 percent (not terrible, but not as precise as the AI). Additionally, it took the AI platform 26 seconds to conduct its analysis, while the average lawyer review time was 92 minutes. Lexis and Westlaw are both developing AI platforms that conduct automated legal syntax research (computer programs that analyze legal arguments and search for cases to support alternative arguments). Legal AI’s most publicized application is in the area of document automation (computer programs that create and electronically file legal documents as simple as an appearance form or as complex as forms necessary for a divorce or probate matter). AI platforms can also predict legal outcomes based on historical jury verdict and settlement information, or even assist lawyers in analyzing potential jurors for a civil or criminal trial. While a highly knowledgeable and experienced lawyer may be able to provide clients with verdict estimates based on dozens or hundreds of trials, an AI platform can analyze millions of verdicts in a matter of seconds and provide more precise and reliable estimates. Most, if not all, work currently done by lawyers can be automated through the use of legal AI."

However, this is not to say the legal profession is doomed to fall to an army of legal robots. Much like all professions confronted with automation and AI, successful lawyers will adapt, survive and thrive. While lawyers will not be completely replaced by automation, most of the lower-skill work lawyers perform (i.e., busy work) will be automated in the very near future. Current AI programs are still fairly poor at writing legal briefs, determining case strategies, presenting evidence and arguments to jurors and negotiating deals with business clients. However, technology runs in a single direction toward improvement. AI platforms are currently being used at some of the world’s largest law firms to perform very specific tasks. While such technology is imperfect, it will continue to improve and become more widespread and affordable."

Lawyers must develop plans for AI development in their practice areas. Lawyers should identify areas of their practice that can be automated and begin to focus on areas of their practice that will be slower to reach the point of automation. It is important to remember that it is no longer a question of if the legal field will become automated, but rather a question of when. While lawyers are highly skilled, they are not exempt from the inevitability of technology. Also, never forget the quote from Alan Lakein: “Failure to plan is planning to fail.” Lawyers who prepare for the upcoming technology changes will be in the best position to thrive in the legal AI environment that is coming sooner than you think."

        "text": "Counsel representing businesses, their owners, or executives regularly earn their legal fees by resolving problems that arise from poor business practices. Those practices often evolved from temporary “fixes” to resolve emergencies or decisions that were never evaluated before they became the standards. Start-up or newly-successful companies often fail to allocate any portion of their budgets toward professional advice to advance their sophistication level in the marketplace. The adage of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a poor defense to sophisticated opponents. Rather than using internet resources, forms from friends, or waiting until emergencies require action, awareness of legal pitfalls and standardization of practices with counsel review will help companies both succeed and defend against claims. Here are three areas prone to legal risk that should be regularly examined:"

        "text": "1. CONTRACTS: Contracts cover everything that a company does, from forming the entity itself (e.g., the Articles of Incorporation or Organization, Bylaws, and Operating Agreements govern how the company will be operated and how the owners will buy/sell their interests), to employing top-level personnel, protecting intellectual property, buying/selling/leasing/licensing property or services, or partnering with others to conduct business. These disputes come in all shapes and sizes, including:"
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "(a) NO CONTRACTS where companies fail to have contracts in place so that disputes require interpreting years of practices (evidenced by varied communications) among a patchwork of persons. It is difficult to enforce “rules” based on little or changing precedent in a course of dealings by the parties, especially when a contingency arises for the first time that spawns disagreement. Always, the best practice is for counsel to prepare a contract for the company to meet its business goals and best protect against legal risk in anticipation of various scenarios between the parties."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "(b) POOR CONTRACTS where companies rely upon the contracts or forms of the other parties with whom they deal, usually at their peril because the forms were either created with terms in favor of the drafter in the first place or fail to protect the non-drafting company’s interests; the pitfalls go unnoticed until a dispute arises which is often too late. Also, owners or executives sometimes try to save money by using forms from friends or the internet, often not knowing what some legal terms mean or lacking the education to know what terms are missing until they get burned by their own drafting errors. One easy example: is there a provision for attorney’s fees to be paid at all, typically by the losing party, if a dispute requires legal intervention? The American rule as to the payment of fees is that each party pays its own fees unless the contract or applicable law provides otherwise. (Conversely, the “English rule” is that the loser pays the winner’s attorney’s fees.) While counsel can educate on the best type of fee provision for a contract at hand, companies are often surprised to learn that they may have a solid legal claim but will be responsible for fees in order to recover the damages they have suffered, perhaps costing more than the value of the claim itself. Another easy example: if the parties are in different states, which state’s laws control disputes under the contract (and has counsel compared the different state laws to select the best scenario for your needs)? Many thousands of dollars are spent by parties on both sides of litigation of a contract dispute if this provision is missing, as well as fighting over proper venue for the lawsuit itself when there is no venue provision."

If a dispute arises, counsel cannot evaluate only the contract itself, but must knit together the years of writings, electronic communications, and a client’s one-sided understanding of verbal agreements. If a legal demand fails to persuade an opponent to resolve a dispute (or the stakes too high to invite reason), costly litigation may be unavoidable in these circumstances. Companies are better served by regularly reviewing their contracts to make sure they comply with their practices and intentions."

Still, the sooner such a review can take place, the earlier that amendments can be made that don’t harm the parties’ relationship; parties typically have good intentions when entering into a contract and will be amenable to making adjustments for their mutual, long-term benefit."

While patent and trademark protection are excluded from this article, companies regularly possess (but do not understand how to protect and maintain) trade secrets. To protect them in most states, companies must identify their trade secrets in policies or memoranda to those who have access to them and prohibit those persons from using or disclosing the trade secrets outside of working for the company; they must also limit access/distribution of those secrets as much as possible with various policies and regularly-employed practices, such as computer access/usage/download rules and the right to search any containers (thumb drives, devices, backpacks, purses, bags, boxes) coming in/out of the premises. Companies must also be diligent about where its secrets are contained and how to exercise control over them (such as on cellular phones or devices and social media accounts like LinkedIn or Facebook). Better, heightened protection of trade secrets includes the use of non-disclosure, non-competition, and/or non-circumvention contracts or policies that are personally signed by all who have access to the sensitive information (which access level should be limited according to function). Protection of intellectual property is an area where relying on forms from friends or the internet can be harmful, as Indiana case law is clear that there is no “one size fits all” and that restrictive provisions must be tailored to match a company’s protectable interests, yet not be overbroad or overreaching, in order for a court to uphold their protections. If the company’s lifeblood is the ownership or development of one or more secrets that competitors cannot readily ascertain, good contracts and policies and practices require retaining specific legal expertise in this area. If a company fails to adequately protect its trade secrets by law, they can become lost (and free to others) forever. Here, an ounce of prevention (in hiring good counsel) is truly worth a pound of cure."

Retention measures include employment contracts for defined terms and benefits that may include bonus plans for attaining goals, profit sharing, and stock options. To avoid losing valued employees to competitors, employment agreements should also include non-compete and non-solicitation provisions. Contracts with vendors, suppliers, and customers can also contain non-solicitation and non-circumvention provisions to protect against their raiding of company employees, customers, or contractors.

        "text": "(a) COMPENSATION is regularly a trouble area for companies. Some companies unwittingly pay employees in ways prohibited by wage laws and face large penalties when caught, like putting people on salary who don’t meet the legal exemptions to be paid on a salary. Companies also fail to recognize the importance of signed/certified records for time worked by each employee, and/or make improper deductions/calculations of wages. Failure to put bonus or paid-time-off policies in writing, or to practice them consistently with those writings, are other high-penalty hits to the company budget when they must be rectified. For example, bonuses intended as discretionary may be imposed automatically, or leave may be on calendar years rather than rolling years, if distributed policies don’t demonstrate otherwise. Companies must make sure they understand the wage laws applicable to the job functions of their various employees and utilize written pay policies or agreements for bonus, leave, and unique pay situations."

        "text": "(b) POLICIES are often missing or piecemeal, failing to “grow” with the company’s workforce. This is understandable when many companies do not employ human resource managers until they have accumulated an unmanageable number of employees. Though not automatically true, the inadequate policies are an indicator of a company’s (likely unknowing) failure to comply with applicable equal employment, anti-discrimination, disability/leave, and other laws that apply to their employees (who are to be informed of those rights) when they apply to the company’s workforce as early in Indiana as when the sixth employee is hired by the company. More problems arise when companies fail to be consistent in applying their policies, resulting in practices different from the policies (or even applicable law). Inconsistent application of policies creates risk when handling matters with employees who enjoy a protected status under the law but are treated differently than everyone else subject to those policies."

        "text": "(c) MISMANAGEMENT of employees is a common occurrence that exposes companies to claims by employees even if they ultimately lack merit. Let employees know the expectations about their job performance, attendance, ethics/honesty, and set a culture acknowledging the importance of each member of the team to foster respect and support in the workplace. The Golden Rule is a great place to start, and from the top down. Employees are going to make mistakes, but counsel them and let them improve because they are an investment worth the effort. Companies that don’t train, mentor, and inspire their employees will suffer a revolving door of disgruntled employees who never graduate to the “A-team” needed for the company’s ultimate success. Disgruntled workers spread ill will inside and outside, they pursue claims, and they can be harmful and even devious – don’t give them a reason to be anything but loyal and proud of being part of the company’s A-team. Good policies, consistent practices, fair treatment, and honesty will help companies avoid being mired down by emergency issues created by unhappy employees and also help to maintain a high level of morale within the company to retain a strong workforce."

        "text": "(d) HANDLING EMPLOYEE EXITS is a dirty job that only the most-sophisticated HR Managers handle well. This means that most companies receive poor grades in this area, even when it involves the voluntary resignation of a long-term employee. First, no matter who is departing and how, protect the company assets by making sure computer access is stopped, keys and property are returned, and emails/phone messages are redirected so they are not lost. Of primary importance is protection of IP rights, so also check the exiting employee’s recent computer activities, particularly items emailed out, downloaded, or printed in the prior 60-90 day period. Second, make sure the employee understands all post-employment obligations (especially including trade secret protection and compliance with any restrictive covenants like non-competition agreements), providing copies of applicable policies or agreements to them on their last day at the office to avoid any denial or misunderstanding about them. If they are subject to restrictions, the company can rightfully ask them about their new employer and duties, etc.; if they refuse to cooperate, that is a red flag that counsel should investigate or pursue a possible breach of those restrictive duties, including possibly notifying the new employer of those duties. Third, make sure the transition for their absence is planned by researching active matters well before their last day of employment; even if a discharge, the company will not want pending leads or sales to be ignored. Fourth, be sure to pay all wages/bonuses due them according to law and applicable policies; failure to do so may cause the company to be liable for interest, penalties, and attorney’s fees. Fifth, if the company pays a penny more in compensation than is due the employee (which it should consider offering a severance if there are possible claims that the employee may pursue), make sure the company receives a legally-compliant release from the departing employee. Counsel involvement is critical here, as releases can be void and thus worthless if they don’t comply with applicable laws. Finally, if any post-employment restrictions apply to the exiting employee, plan to monitor their activities early and then monthly until the restrictions have expired so that any compliance issues may be promptly addressed and the company’s interests remain protected. If not, waiver in pursuing a breach could negatively affect the ability to enforce those restrictions against subsequently-departing employees, or even render those restrictions unenforceable as to everyone."

Therefore, although we agree that whether Speaks received Sotradecol is a “material” fact because it could affect the outcome of her case, we nevertheless conclude that Speaks has failed in her burden to demonstrate that this issue is “genuine.” . . . Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Rao and Porter Hospital on this issue was appropriate."

In the age of EMRs, the adage that the “record speaks for itself” is rarely (if ever) accurate. While the conclusion in Speaks may seem obvious to most people, courts are generally reluctant to grant summary judgment – especially when there is the slightest shred of evidence to support a plaintiff’s claim. That being said, evidence must still be viewed under the lens of reasonableness – not hypothetical possibilities. While it was possible the patient in Speaks received Sotradecol as the chart indicated, such an inference was not reasonable in light of the designated evidence showing a computer error. While health care providers must take care when working with EMRs, it is comforting to know they will not be held liable for computer errors like the one that occurred in Speaks."

The definition of reasonableness varies depending on a multitude of factors applicable to the sophistication level of the owner’s business. Because there is “no one size fits all” analysis to determine whether something qualifies as a trade secret — including whether its owner took reasonable measures to protect it — a lawyer tasked with protecting a client’s trade secrets must be intimately familiar with the client’s protectable interests. This article outlines the factors that should be considered to best protect a client’s trade secrets under Indiana’s trade secret laws."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "First, the attorney must understand how a trade secret exists in the first place. In 1982, Indiana joined other states and adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“UTSA”), codifying it at Indiana Code §24-2-3-1 et seq. In 2016, a separate federal law entitled the “Defend Trade Secrets Act” was derived from the UTSA."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Indiana Code §24-2-3-2 defines a “trade secret” as any information having two distinct parts: (1) it derives independent economic value (actual or potential) from not being generally known or readily ascertainable by persons who would benefit from its disclosure or use, and; (2) it is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. In layman’s terms, the information constituting a trade secret is valuable because competitors cannot readily find or obtain it (without extensive time, effort or expense) and because the owner has done all things reasonable to protect it. Both prongs are often disputed when trade secret claims are litigated, but the lawyer’s role usually has played a part long before the owner’s claims can be addressed by a court. If the lawyer’s advice or protective documentation falls short such that a court finds that the measures employed were insufficient, the information is not deemed a trade secret."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Second, the attorney must know the available tools, and which ones to utilize, in order to maintain the protected status of a trade secret. Protective measures that are “reasonable under the circumstances” will vary depending upon the size or sophistication of the owner. It makes sense that a small family-owned business will not have to match the levels of protection employed by public companies with legal and human resources departments to protect their secrets. But no matter the company’s size, a court must nevertheless find that the protective measures taken were reasonable. The variety of available tools to protect trade secrets is broad, but Indiana courts have not suggested a hierarchy or singular standard that will automatically deem any particular steps as reasonable."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Examples of protective measures found in Indiana cases include: (1) access to the secret information restricted to those with a need to know it to perform their tasks for the owner; (2) physical marking of the secret information as proprietary property of the company; (3) storage of the secret information in locked/secured locations and password-restricted on computer systems; (4) policies/practices for the regular return and destruction of confidential information; (5) confidentiality and non-disclosure policies/agreements; (6) non-competition agreements; (7) policies/practices such as prohibition of storage devices or cameras at work and limiting privacy rights to permit searches for violations, and; (8) practices to ensure compliance such as exit interviews, post-termination reminders of ongoing obligations, investigations of possible violations and enforcement of rights when violations occur. Attorneys are wise to include protective measures as to anyone with access to proprietary information, such as third-party contractors, vendors and suppliers; even plant tours contributed to trade secret status being denied in one case (Zemco Mfg., Inc. v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 759 N.E.2d 239 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001).) Therefore, be sure to determine the extent of the client’s disclosures in employing protective measures."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Third, the attorney must be a skilled draftsman in implementing the tools necessary to best protect the client’s trade secrets. This is where a lot of attorneys go on “automatic pilot” and fail to meet their client’s needs. In utilizing forms that are not customized for their client’s particular business, attorneys may leave proprietary client information unprotected. The litmus test is typically whether the policy/provision expressly identifies the information that is considered a secret and how it is to be protected. Indeed, where restrictive provisions are so complex that employees cannot decipher them, courts will refuse to enforce them. (See Clark’s Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Smith, 4 N.E.3d 772 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014).) While ample seminars and materials abound to teach attorneys the best ways to draft necessary policies and restrictive agreements, the need for competency in the subject area and customization to match the client’s true protectable interests (including their identity/scope, life cycle, breadth of goodwill and persons/activities subject to the necessary measures) cannot be understated."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Fourth, the attorney must educate the client about best practices in maintaining and updating protection of trade secrets. Clients must understand that proactive employment of the drafted policies/agreements is critical to protect trade secrets. When clients simply put the documents on a shelf such that only some of the persons accessing secret information have duties to keep it confidential, then the protective measures erode until the trade secret status is lost. Similarly, as clients develop new or different levels of proprietary information, their counsel should audit and update their protective measures to satisfy the reasonableness standard. Clients should be informed that their own failure to follow counsel’s advice can mean that they will have no trade secrets for protection. Companies that regularly remind everyone of their confidentiality obligations will be prepared to refute defense claims of having no knowledge of their obligations respecting the information. Equally important, clients must stay alert to possible misappropriation of trade secrets and prosecute them; if they fail, their secret information is diluted and no longer a trade secret."

Do not fall prey to all of the available forms and lists without understanding how much is really necessary. If a client’s only trade secret is its customer list, be bold enough to focus the drafting energy there."

Code §34-18-7-1, it has also held that if an act of malpractice and resulting injury cannot be discovered during the limitations period given the nature of the asserted malpractice and the medical condition, the occurrence-based statute of limitations cannot be enforced “without doing violence to the Indiana Constitution.”[3]",

In 2008, the Indiana Supreme Court recognized the difficulty of uniformly applying Ind. Code §34-18-7-1, because medical malpractice claims may be asserted in a variety of contexts including, among others: failure to diagnose an unknown progressive condition such as cancer; failure to arrest or cure a known progressive condition such as a degenerative eye condition; or substandard treatment such as surgery on the wrong limb.[4] Similarly, the circumstances alerting the patient to the injury or potential of malpractice can vary widely.[5] Thus, when considering whether the Act’s statute of limitations may constitutionally bar a malpractice claim, a court must first “determine the date the alleged malpractice occurred and determine the discovery date [trigger date]—the date when the patient discovered the alleged malpractice and resulting injury, or possessed enough information that would have led a reasonably diligent person to make such discovery.”[6]",

        "text": "As noted above, in some circumstances, such as where the physician operates on the wrong limb, the date of the occurrence of malpractice is obvious. However, where the care at issue is not confined to a single act or physician-patient encounter, the date of occurrence may not be as obvious. Indiana appellate courts have held that in situations where an entire course of conduct combines to produce an injury, the conduct may constitute a continuing wrong so as to delay the running of the statute of limitations.[7] That is, the statute of limitations is tolled “so that it does not commence running until the wrongful act ceases.”[8] This so called “doctrine of continuing wrong” is not an equitable doctrine but, rather, is a legal concept used to define when an act, omission or neglect [i.e. the “occurrence”] took place.[9] While plaintiffs have frequently attempted to invoke the doctrine of continuing wrong to extend the occurrence based statute of limitations, appellate courts apply the doctrine narrowly.[10] For instance, “the prescription of medicine constitutes a single act of malpractice and not an entire course of conduct, such that the doctrine of continuing wrong does not apply.”[11] When the alleged continuing wrong is a failure to diagnose, the omission cannot extend beyond the time the physician last had opportunity to diagnosis and treat.[12] Nevertheless, patients may not sit idly by after discovering facts that alert them that they may have a cause of action, and the doctrine of continuing wrong will not prevent the statute of limitations from beginning to run when a patient learns of facts which should lead to the discovery of a cause of action even if the physician-patient relationship continues beyond that point.[13]",

There must be some affirmative act which amounts to more than passive silence.[17] The principal significance of the distinction between the two branches of the fraudulent concealment doctrine, active and passive, lies in the different points in time at which a patient must commence a malpractice action.[18] When the concealment is passive, a patient’s duty of due diligence in filing a claim is triggered by the termination of the physician-patient relationship or by the actual discovery or reasonable opportunity to discover the malpractice, whichever occurs first. When the concealment is active, patient’s duty of due diligence in filing a claim does not commence until such actual or reasonably possible discovery of the malpractice.[19]",

The trigger date is the time when a patient either knows of the malpractice and the resulting injury or learns of facts that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should lead to the discovery of the malpractice and resulting injury.[22] Reasonable diligence in the context of discovering medical malpractice claims requires a patient to take action if he or she knows of both the injury and/or disease and the treatment that either caused or failed to identify or improve it.[23] A patient’s “lay suspicion” that there may have been malpractice is generally not sufficient to trigger the two-year period.[24] However, when it is undisputed that a patient’s doctor has expressly informed a patient that he has a specific injury and that there is a reasonable possibility, if not a probability, that the specific injury was caused by a specific act at a specific time, then a patient is generally deemed to have sufficient facts to require him to seek promptly any additional medical or legal advice needed to resolve any remaining uncertainty or confusion he may have regarding the cause of his injury and any legal recourse he may have.[25] An unexplained failure to do so does not excuse a failure to timely file a claim.[26] Also, neither inconvenience nor difficulty in proceeding is enough to toll the statute, if diligence would lead to the discovery of facts giving rise to the claim.[27]",

Despite such interest in sports gambling, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 1992, prohibiting states from regulating gambling for competitive sporting events.[1] However, in a landmark decision in May 2018, the United States Supreme Court held that PASPA imposed unconstitutional restrictions on states’ rights to regulate sports gambling.[2] As a result, several state legislatures, including Indiana’s, have quickly reacted to the Supreme Court’s decision by proposing or enacting legislation to legalize and regulate sports gambling in their respective states. This article explains the Supreme Court’s recent decision, the sports gambling legislation proposed in the Indiana legislature, and possible concerns arising from legalized sports gambling in Indiana.",

National Collegiate Athletic Association[3], finding that PASPA presented an unconstitutional violation of states’ rights with respect to the authorization of sports gambling schemes. Specifically, Murphy challenged a 2014 New Jersey statute that sought to repeal state prohibitions on sports wagering. As a result of New Jersey’s 2014 legislation, several professional and amateur sports leagues brought an action against Philip Murphy, the Governor of New Jersey, to enjoin him from enacting this legislation, pursuant to the prohibition in PASPA. The Supreme Court held that PASPA’s prohibition on states’ regulation of sports gambling violated the anti-commandeering rule of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves all legislative power not otherwise conferred on Congress by the United States Constitution to the states and was therefore unconstitutional.[4] Consequently, the Supreme Court permitted New Jersey, and all other states, to legislate issues surrounding the authorization and regulation of sports gambling.[5]",

If you have thought about establishing (or updating) a Will or Trust or other documents but have not taken steps to do so, you are not alone. Statistics show that less than 25% of people who would benefit from the legal or tax aspects of a Will or Trust have them in place. And for those with estate planning documents in place, most haven’t reviewed or updated their plans for years. Planning for your death or incapacity, or that of your spouse, is not easy to think or talk about. However, once the documents are in place and up to date, it will provide you a level of comfort knowing that your current wishes and plans to provide and care for your family and those persons and causes important to you, are in place. This article provides an overview of several estate planning topics and considerations."

Your Will or Revocable Trust can establish trusts for your minor or adult children with a trustee that you choose. A trust allows you to control the conditions upon which your children receive the property you leave them and avoids leaving money or other assets to your children (regardless of age) if they are not ready or capable of managing such assets on their own. A trust can also be used to avoid certain issues created by leaving money to a minor (including the need for a court to appoint a financial guardian with cumbersome and often expensive court reporting requirements) and to provide for a child until he or she receives his or her inheritance at an age selected by you (at least 18 and often older). Proper planning also allows you to document your desires (which are almost always determinative) as to the person(s) who will be appointed to raise your minor children. Without such a designation, one or more family members may file and pursue (and fight over) being appointed guardian over minor children."

If you do not have a Will or Revocable Trust, however, your surviving spouse is unlikely to receive all of your individual assets. For example, in Indiana, if you die without children but at least one of your parents survives you, your spouse will only receive a portion (likely 75%) of your individually-owned assets, with the remainder going to your parents. Or, if you die with children, there will be a split of individually-owned assets between your surviving spouse and your children (regardless of age). Unmarried couples will generally not receive any of the individually owned assets of the first of them to die, making planning a necessity for those couples. Planning for spouses, partners or significant others can avoid these unintended results."

For couples in these marriages, especially those where children are involved, estate planning is even more critical to ensure that the surviving spouse and all children and families involved are provided for. These couples must consider and find a balance that addresses the often competing interests of taking care of a surviving spouse while ensuring that any children of either spouse are adequately provided for at the time of the first spouse’s death and after the death of the survivor. Without proper planning, all assets of one spouse could pass to the surviving spouse who could, intentionally or even unintentionally, leave those assets to only the survivor’s children and/or a new spouse upon their death, with nothing going to the children or family of the first spouse to die. Planning in these situations often involves some combination of a trust, life insurance, and other planning tools that ensure the surviving spouse, all children involved, and other family members of each spouse are provided for in the manner that the couple chooses."

This is because the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has nearly doubled the already significant lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion to $11.18 Million per person for 2018, so the vast majority of estates are not subject to federal gift and estate tax. This lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion, which will adjust for inflation until it sunsets in 2025 (unless extended by Congress), is in addition to the unlimited marital deduction, which allows you to leave an unlimited amount of property to your surviving spouse tax free, and the annual gift tax exclusion, which in 2018 will enable you to gift up to $15,000 per donee of your choosing."

For tax determination purposes, the calculation of one’s gross estate generally includes the value of beneficiary-designated assets such as life insurance policies and retirement accounts. Many of our clients are surprised by this, especially concerning life insurance proceeds, an asset generally understood to be ‘non-taxable’, which is likely true with respect to income taxes but not for establishing the amount of your gross estate subject to gift and estate tax. Aside from the total value of an individual’s assets, there are certain types of assets you may own that require tax-specific planning and other matters that could make taxes an essential consideration in preparing your estate plans."

Business succession planning addresses matters of whether family member(s) or others, such as business partners or employees, will own or run the business after the owner’s death. These succession planning considerations bring their own dynamics and challenges, which are particularly difficult when deciding which child or children and/or other family member(s) to involve in the future ownership and operation of a company. Generally, the current owner(s) knows what is best for the future of the company. A failure to put in place a succession plan can result in significant adverse consequences for both the business and family after the owner’s death, including disputes, unfairness (among children, for example), loss of value to the business, unintended tax consequences, or even the failure of the business. A significant number of businesses do not make it to or through a second (or later) generation, and a failure of the current ownership to plan will almost certainly increase that likelihood."

Another type of advanced directive is a living will, which expresses your wishes as to the use or continued use of life-prolonging measures.

However, sworn testimony provided in an unemployment case is not a “conclusion” or “finding of fact” and may be admissible as evidence in a discrimination case. For example, if the employee testifies under oath in an unemployment hearing that he consumed alcohol on the Company’s premises during his work day, that statement itself may be admissible as impeachment evidence if he changes his testimony in the discrimination case. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d),. For this reason alone it may be worth challenging an unemployment compensation claim."

To address these inequities, under the new law, the partnership may elect to “push-out” the partnership’s tax liability for an Adjusted Year to the partners—including former partners who were partners during the Adjusted Year—who will pay their share of the tax based on their respective percentage interests for the Adjusted Year. LLCs that desire to “push-out” the partnership’s tax liability should amend their Operating Agreements to ensure that partners during an Adjusted Year are contractually bound to pay their share of the additional tax, whether or not those partners are currently partners, or whether their percentage interests have changed in the interim."

Immediate thoughts go to how this will impact trial preparations and perhaps even the trial date. To the extent that the deposition of the opposing party went well and limited the scope of the expert’s testimony, there may be significant concerns as to whether the opposing party will now be able to improve its case by designating a new expert.

Possibly, but not likely. Though local practice distinguishes between discovery and evidentiary/trial depositions, Indiana discovery rules draw no formal distinction. In Hagerman Const., Inc. v. Copeland, the Court of Appeals held that a deposition of an expert who was not present at trial was admissible even though one of the parties asserted that it had limited its cross-examination because it was a discovery deposition.[1] However, the Court of Appeals reached its decision, in part, based upon its determination that the party had indeed extensively cross-examined the expert. Here, the circumstances are different because, as often reflected in local practice, opposing counsel did not extensively examine his own expert at the deposition. As such, an Indiana court would most likely find that it would be unduly prejudicial to the opposing party to limit its expert’s testimony to essentially his responses to your examination.",

In other words, allowing this supplement is NOT an invitation to Plaintiffs to introduce new and different theories in this case.” Surprisingly, Indiana Insurance designated two new experts and Valmont objected. The court struck one expert because he failed the Daubert test, and struck portions of the second expert’s opinion on the basis that the second expert presented new theories that were not identified or relied upon by the deceased expert."

        "text": "Similarly, in Lincoln Nat., though the parties agreed to the substitution, they could not agree on the scope. Lincoln maintained that the new expert should be limited to the theories and conclusions previously advanced by the original expert. The court conducted a review of other cases that analyzed this issue and noted that when substitution is allowed, courts generally limit the scope of the testimony that may be given by the new expert. “The introduction of a substitute expert does not ipso facto permit the party requesting the substitution to escape from the concessions or admissions of the previous expert. Rather, the substitute expert’s report and testimony are frequently limited to the subject matter and theories already espoused by the former expert.”[4] However, the court noted that the substitute expert is not normally required to simply adopt the prior expert’s conclusions verbatim—in effect, doing little more than authenticating and confirming the prior expert’s conclusions. The substitute expert “should have the opportunity to express his opinions in his own language after reviewing the evidence and performing whatever tests prior experts on both sides were allowed to perform.” In the end, the court concluded that Transamerica could designate a new expert, but that the substitute expert must have a “similar area of expertise” as the original expert and would be permitted to conduct his own investigation and reach his own conclusions, as long as he addressed the same subject matter as original expert’s report without meaningful changes.",

For purposes of fairness, the other party should be permitted an opportunity to depose the new expert. However, while limiting the scope of the opinions of the new expert and allowing additional discovery of the new expert minimizes the prejudice to the other party, it is still possible that the moving party may be able to improve its position in the case with a substitute expert. Perhaps the new expert will be more adept at presenting the opinions and providing support for such opinions, particularly since the substitute expert will have the advantage of reviewing the prior expert’s deposition. Therefore, even though the scope of the new expert’s opinions will be limited, some prejudice seems inevitable."

Indiana’s POST Law was first enacted in 2013 and was designed to create a standardized State Form (State Form 55317) for individuals to designate their end-of-life medical intervention decisions in a form that is signed by the patient’s physician and treated as a physician order. The form provides physician orders regarding CPR-code or no code status; level of medical intervention (comfort measures, limited additional interventions, or full intervention); use of antibiotics (for comfort only or full treatment); and use of medically-administered nutrition. The comfort measures level stipulates: “Patient prefers no transfer to the hospital for life-sustaining treatment; Transfer only if comfort needs cannot be met in current location.” Use of the POST form was designed to better identify and respect a patient’s preferences for treatment at life’s end. In 2018, the Indiana Legislature updated the POST Law to allow Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants (NPs and PAs) to work with patients who wish to complete a POST directive. The updated law (effective on July 1, 2018) allows NPs and PAs to sign the form in lieu of the patient’s treating physician. The update to Indiana’s POST Law is recognition that NPs and PAs are being heavily utilized as physician extenders in today’s health care system and such providers can assist patients with taking advantage of Indiana’s POST Law.",

For several decades, Indiana statutes have specified a list of individuals that could provide medical consent under such circumstances (including a spouse, a parent, an adult child, an adult grandchild, an adult sibling, or a grandparent). However, Indiana law was previously silent on the hierarchy of such individuals in the medical consent process. Such a process left health care providers in untenable situations in which family members disagreed as to medical intervention issues. Hospitals would often seek appointment of a court-appointed guardian for the incapacitated patient to sort out disagreements amongst family members. The appointment of a guardian often caused delay and confusion during an already difficult medical situation. However, effective July 1, 2018, health care providers can rely on a priority order of hierarchy, found under I.C. § 16-36-1-5, for issues concerning medical consent. Generally, the hierarchy specifies the following individuals for medical consent:",

By allowing PAs and NPs to assist patients with POST directives, patients faced with a terminal disease or other serious illness will have easier access to POST directives. The new hierarchy for medical consent provides patients and providers clear guidelines for medical consent issues. If patients have concerns about the hierarchy established under the updated law, such individuals are free to create an advanced healthcare directive (a.k.a. “living will”) with an alternative hierarchy that would supersede the generic hierarchy established under the new law. Indiana’s updated law does not prohibit or overrule advanced healthcare directives – in fact, it encourages such arrangements. As Indiana’s updated law is implemented in the coming months, health care providers and patients will benefit from the clarity provided by the updated law."

The OAG is only required to make a “reasonable attempt” to notify the practitioner that a summary suspension hearing will take place and of the allegation(s) against the practitioner. [4] A “reasonable attempt” to contact the practitioner is made if the OAG “attempts to reach the practitioner by telephone or facsimile at the last telephone number of the practitioner on file with the board.”[5] Thus, an unanswered fax or telephone call to the practitioner on the day of the hearing satisfies the notice requirements for a summary suspension. Further, “a court may not stay or vacate a summary suspension of a practitioner’s license for the sole reason that the practitioner was not notified.”[6] Moreover, due to the emergency nature of the action, no continuances are granted once the summary suspension hearing is set. “[T]he practitioner may not petition the board for a delay of the summary suspension proceedings.”[7]",

The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision, deciding that service advisors are included in the aforementioned FLSA exemption, and thus they are not entitled to overtime pay.

As a result, if you elect to acquire ownership of a company by purchasing the stock or ownership units of the company from the seller, you are not only acquiring its assets, but also any and every obligation and liability of the company. This includes readily identifiable obligations and liabilities, such as the company’s bank debt and trade payables, as well as every potential or even concealed liability arising out of the seller’s prior operation of the business, such as income or sales tax deficiencies (or even tax fraud), potential product liability, warranty, environmental, and employment claims, and others. While a well-written stock/unit purchase agreement might give the buyer the right to file suit if the seller fails to disclose existing or potential claims, and the buyer might also have rights against the seller under applicable federal and state securities laws, those rights may be little comfort to the buyer after he realizes that he may be required to spend several years and tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation to obtain a judgment against the seller – a judgment that might not even be collectible. Because of the hidden liabilities that exist when a buyer acquires ownership of the company itself, buyers overwhelmingly prefer to acquire only the assets of a company.",

In connection with an asset purchase, the asset purchase agreement will generally include a clear statement that the buyer is NOT assuming any liabilities of the seller, with the exception of liabilities that are expressly assumed by the buyer under the terms of the agreement. As a result (with certain exceptions discussed below), a buyer of assets has the option to pick and choose what debts and liabilities of the company he wants to assume, if any. For example, it is common for a buyer to assume the seller’s liability for current trade payables and current payroll obligations (so as not to disrupt relationships with the company’s vendors and employees), as well as any leases for the seller’s equipment and facilities – all of which are items that should be readily identifiable and quantifiable at the time of the acquisition. However, it would be extremely unusual for a buyer to agree to assume the seller’s tax liabilities, or any potential product liability, warranty, environmental, or employment-related claims, or to assume any other claims or liabilities that are not specifically identifiable and quantifiable."

          "Undertaking a comprehensive lien/judgment search. As most experienced business people know, the holder of a lien has the right to seize the property that is subject to the lien (real estate, equipment, accounts receivable, intellectual property rights, bank accounts, etc.) to satisfy the debt that the lien secures. Liens can be granted voluntarily by the owner of the property (such as a mortgage lien), or imposed involuntarily by law, such as a tax lien or a judgment lien. If a buyer purchases property that is subject to a lien, the lien stays on the property irrespective of the transfer. Moreover, in the case of a voluntary lien, it is almost always the case that the document creating the lien (a mortgage in the case of real estate, or a security agreement in the case of most other types of property) will state that any sale of the property by the seller is itself a “default” that allows the lienholder to seize the property. Although the law requires a public notice to be filed for nearly every type of lien, the problem is that different types of liens are filed in completely different government offices, and a court judgment may only appear in the records of court where the judgment was rendered (which could be anywhere in the country). As a result, identifying the liens and judgments to which a business is subject can be a very complicated task requiring the services of a professional lien search company.",
          "Undertaking a detailed review/inspection of the company’s records and operations, with supporting warranties and representations in the purchase agreement. Most law firms who represent business clients have developed a standard “due diligence checklist” that is used to assist clients with business acquisitions. These checklists detail the information and documents that the seller should be requested to provide regarding every facet of its business, including copies of the seller’s tax returns and financial statements for at least the last five years; copies of all contracts relevant to the operation of the business (such as leases, customer contracts, software and other intellectual property licenses, vendor contracts and employment agreements); a roster of employees together with wage rates, copies of commission programs, bonus programs and the seller’s employee handbook; a description and copies of all pension, health and other employee benefit plans and programs; customer lists and sales records and forecasts; vendor lists and records; equipment lists and depreciation schedules; an inventory listing; a listing and copies of all licenses and permits; a description and documentation regarding any past, existing, threatened or potential claims and litigation involving the company, and much more. The buyer’s legal counsel and accounting firm typically assist the buyer in reviewing and evaluating the information provided by the seller from the due diligence process. Additionally, a well-written stock/unit purchase agreement will then include “warranties and representations” by the seller, in which the seller assures the buyer that all of the information and documents provided to the buyer are accurate and complete – such that the seller would potentially be liable for “fraud” (including a possible award of punitive damages) if false or misleading has been provided to the buyer."

Although a buyer is not generally responsible for the seller’s liabilities (except as to any liabilities that the buyer expressly agrees to assume), various state or federal statutes can create: (i) liens that automatically arise by reason of the seller’s cessation of business; and (ii) liabilities that are automatically imposed on the buyer. As a result, it is imperative that the potential imposition of these automatic liens and liabilities be identified before the purchase of the seller’s assets is consummated, so that the buyer can decide whether to proceed with the transaction, or to perhaps negotiate an adjustment in the purchase price. These statutory liens and liabilities include the following –"

Employers who employ 20 or more employees and provide a health insurance program are required to give employees (and their covered dependents) the option to remain on that health plan for a period following the employee’s termination of employment or after certain other circumstances where coverage would otherwise be lost. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a buyer who “continues the business operations associated with the assets purchased from the [seller] without interruption or substantial change” is required to allow anyone who has elected COBRA continuation coverage under the seller’s plan to continue that coverage under the buyer’s plan, if the seller discontinues its plan (which generally happens after a company’s assets are sold).",
          "Retirement Plan Liabilities. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) is the federal agency that insures workers’ pension benefits under certain types of pension plans. If a company sells its assets and ceases business without fully funding any pension plan insured by the PBGC, a lien on the seller’s assets will be automatically imposed under federal law in favor of the PBGC. Additionally, a company that employs union employees and contributes to a national or regional union pension plan on behalf of its union employees may incur “withdrawal liability” if it sells its assets and ceases operating. This withdrawal liability represents the amount of the accrued pension liabilities attributable to the company’s former employees, and can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. The federal courts have held that in appropriate circumstances, where there has been a continuity in the operations before and after an asset sale, the buyer can be held liable for the seller’s withdrawal liability.",
          "Unemployment insurance. Indiana law provides that a buyer who acquires substantially all of the assets of another company becomes liable for any deficiencies in the seller’s historical unemployment insurance payments. In addition, the buyer becomes subject to a higher unemployment tax rate until the seller’s deficiency is eliminated.",
          "Wage-Hour laws. The federal courts have held that in certain cases where there has been a continuity of operations before and after an asset sale, the buyer can be held liable for the seller’s violations of the federal minimum wage and overtime laws (the “Fair Labor Standards Act”).",
          "Bulk Sales law. In any case where: (i) the seller’s principal business involves the sale of inventory from stock, (ii) the buyer proposes to purchase of more than half the seller’s inventory, and (iii) the seller will not continue to operate the same business after the sale, the sale may be subject to Indiana’s “bulk sales” rules. These rules require, among other things, that certain notices be provided to potential creditors of the seller. If the buyer fails to comply with these rules, then the buyer becomes liable for the seller’s financial obligations to the seller’s creditors.",
          "General successorship principles. A court can impose “successor liability” on the buyer of a company’s assets, and hold the buyer responsible for any or all of the seller’s liabilities, where sale occurs under fraudulent or other suspicious circumstances. For example, courts have imposed successor liability on a buyer where the owners and management of the buyer were substantially the same as the owners and management of the seller. In addition, if the buyer is owned by one or more persons affiliated with the seller and the asset sale is made at a bargain price, the court may consider the transaction to be fraudulent."

          "A “hold-back”. One of the best protections a buyer can have to absorb the financial expense of a seller liability is to insist on holding back a portion of the purchase price. This hold-back is generally reflected in a promissory note payable to the seller after a period of at least one year. Both the promissory note and the purchase agreement would then contain language expressly stating that in the event that the buyer is called upon to pay any seller liability not expressly assumed by the buyer, the buyer will have the right to deduct the amount of that payment from the amount payable under the note. In effect, this promissory note becomes the buyer’s “insurance policy” against liability for the seller’s obligations.",
          "Comprehensive indemnification provisions backed by both the seller and its owners. A purchase agreement should contain indemnification provisions, describing in detail the seller’s obligation to indemnify and hold the buyer harmless with respect to any claims against the buyer (including the buyer’s attorneys’ fees) arising out of any seller liabilities that were not expressly assumed by the buyer. In addition, is important to make certain that the seller’s owners, are: (i) specifically identified as parties to the agreement in their individual capacities and sign the agreement in their individual capacities; (ii) specifically join in the representations and warranties being made by the seller; and (iii) specifically obligated, along with the seller, to fulfill the indemnity obligations under the purchase agreement. Why is this important? Consider what will happen as a result of and immediately following the closing. At the closing, the seller will convey all of its assets to the buyer for the purchase price, such that immediately after the closing the seller will have no assets other than the cash paid by the buyer. Then, either at or immediately after the closing, the seller will use the sale proceeds to pay off whatever obligations the buyer did not assume, and will immediately distribute the balance to the seller’s owners. That means that if the buyer subsequently has an indemnity claim, and the only one obligated by the indemnity provisions of the purchase agreement is the company that was the seller, the buyer will be presenting its indemnity claim to a company with no cash or other assets! The moral of the story is to follow the money: since the owners will end up with the money, they should be parties to the purchase agreement and be legally obligated under its indemnity provisions."

Rather, the plaintiff’s complaint is subject to the Act if the “tenor” of the complaint, taken as a whole, is one of medical negligence, such as when the complaint generally alleges that the qualified provider was negligent in providing care to the patient or questions the judgment of the qualified provider when making health care decisions.[4] See, for example, Putnam County Hospital v. Sells, wherein the patient fell out of a hospital bed while under general anesthesia and suffered injuries. The patient filed suit against the hospital, alleging that its staff was negligent by failing to ensure that the side guardrails of the hospital bed were in place to prevent a fall.[5] The allegations, which questioned the hospital’s decision on how to prevent falls of patients under general anesthesia, challenged the treatment decisions of the health care provider and were deemed to be allegations of medical negligence that fell “squarely within the scope of the Act.”[6]",

In Caylor-Nickel, the hospital did have bedrails in place on the patient’s bed. However, the patient fell from his hospital bed when the guardrail collapsed as he attempted to use it for support. The patient subsequently filed a complaint against the hospital alleging that the “direct and proximate cause of the fall of Plaintiff was the negligence of the Defendants.” The patient also filed an affidavit which specifically alleged ordinary negligence and not medical negligence.[9] The Court of Appeals held that the tenor of the patient’s complaint supported an allegation of ordinary negligence, as the patient did not allege any “breach of duty directly associated with medical care” that would have subjected his claim to the Act.[10]",

Lomax, wherein the plaintiff sued the hospital for injuries sustained after tripping on a protruding floorboard while leaving a dressing room area without the assistance of any hospital employees.[11] The plaintiff’s complaint did not allege that the injury resulted from malpractice or that the hospital failed to render appropriate medical care, and the patient had not received medical treatment prior to or at the time of her fall.[12] Accordingly, the Act did not apply. See also Pluard v. Patients Compensation Fund,[13] wherein a newborn suffered injuries after a surgical lamp detached from the wall and fell on his head. The plaintiff’s allegations were deemed to arise from ordinary rather than medical negligence because the injury was caused by the lamp’s detachment from the wall (an issue of premises liability), and not the medical provider’s judgment in positioning of the lamp.[14]",

First, a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over claims for medical negligence until after a Medical Review Panel has issued its written opinion. Thus, where a patient files a medical negligence claim against a qualified health care provider and fails to simultaneously file a proposed complaint with the Indiana Department of Insurance, the patient’s court complaint may be subject to dismissal for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction challenges cannot be waived and may be raised even for the first time on appeal.[15]",

Specifically, the Act limits the amount a plaintiff may recover for injuries sustained as a result of medical negligence that occurred after June 30, 2017 and before July 1, 2019, to $1,650,000, of which $400,000 would be paid by the health care provider with the remainder paid by the patient’s compensation fund. The provider’s share of its exposure could be further limited through the purchase of an annuity in an amount that complies with the Act’s provisions.[17] If the negligence alleged does not fall within the purview of the Act, then the provider defendant is not entitled to the Act’s above protections.",

The jury determines the patient’s economic and noneconomic damages total $3,000,000. If that fall occurred because the patient was a known fall risk and fell as a result of the health care provider’s failure to implement fall prevention interventions (which requires an exercise of medical/nursing judgment), then the Act would apply and the provider’s exposure would be capped at $400,000. However, if the patient fell as a result of water being allowed to accumulate on the floor (a defect in the premises), the Act would not apply and the provider’s exposure would be $3,000,000. Quite simply, the Act’s impact on the liability of a provider can be significant."

Asking a few simple questions at the start of litigation – such as “Does the plaintiff question the health care decisions of the provider?” and “Were the plaintiff’s injuries the result of equipment failure or an improperly-maintained premises?” – could avoid a provider’s exposure to potentially excessive jury awards."

This means they do not decide the outcome of disputes in the first place; rather, they decide whether an issue was correctly decided. Their job is similar to that of the replay officials in an NFL game.[1] Just as an NFL referee’s initial call might be overturned only where there is “indisputable evidence” the original call was incorrect, our appellate courts similarly are bound by what are known as “standards of review.” Think of a standard of review as a lens through which an appellate court must review a dispute. And, those lenses vary, depending on the type of issue being reviewed."

We affirm a verdict when, considering the probative evidence and reasonable inferences, a reasonable jury could have arrived at the same determination.”[2] In other words, when a trial court or jury decides the credibility of witnesses or the believability of a given statement, our appellate courts generally decline to revisit that decision."

Instead, the most common method of bringing a dispute before the Indiana Supreme Court is by asking our Supreme Court to grant “transfer” after<after< i=””> the Indiana Court of Appeals has decided an appeal. However, our Supreme Court is quite selective about which cases it decides to order “transferred” from the Court of Appeals, and it generally will do so only when: (1) there is a conflict between Court of Appeals decisions; (2) a Court of Appeals decision conflicts with a Supreme Court decision; (3) a Court of Appeals decision conflicts with federal appellate law; (4) the Court of Appeals has decided an important question of law or a case of great public importance on which our Supreme Court should weigh in; (5) a Court of Appeals decision has correctly decided existing precedent, but that precedent should be clarified, modified, or changed; or (6) a Court of Appeals decision has “gone rogue” by so significantly departing from accepted law or practice that our Supreme Court feels a need to step in. Aside from these situations, our Supreme Court generally will not take a case.[5] Needless to say, these situations do not arise often.</after<>"

And, you may wish to seek a second opinion from an attorney who was not involved at trial, because he or she may provide a fresh perspective which often is helpful in pursuing an appeal."

In general, ESI includes emails, documents, spreadsheets, and text messages. Many companies have formal document retention policies which describe how the company is to preserve ESI. Yet, not all companies have such policies. Since not all companies have document retention policies, the practice of sending “Litigation Hold” letters has become common. Whether you are an owner of a small, local business or General Counsel of a Fortune 500 company, it is critically important to keep an eye out for Litigation Hold letters, since Litigation Hold letters may impose strict standards on your company for retaining documents which may become relevant in future litigation."

Investigation of the claim or potential claim could still be ongoing, but by sending you the Litigation Hold letter, the sender is most likely imposing a burden on you to preserve certain documents. We have identified five (5) steps to take if you find yourself in receipt of a Litigation Hold letter."

Although the letter may sound fairly straightforward, and your initial reaction to the letter may be that you believe that you have already taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the requests outlined in the letter, we strongly recommend that you contact counsel right away. The primary reason for reaching out to counsel is to let counsel review the letter, then evaluate whether a response is appropriate. In many circumstances, even a brief response to the letter could help protect your company’s interests in the long run. For example, if the letter requires preservation of “all electronic data,” your counsel could write back and explain your company’s ordinary document retention policy, and offer to preserve additional data from certain employees. By responding to the letter, you are notifying the sender of your plan for responding to the letter and are protecting your company’s interests moving forward, in the event that suit is filed."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",

If the Litigation Hold letter is drafted as broadly as most, it will likely seek documents specifically relating to the matter at issue (for example, the file relating to a particular customer or client), but also may seek documents relating to broader corporate policies. Study the letter closely, and work with counsel to make sure you understand which documents are covered by the request."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "3. Identify employees who may have responsive information. Take a careful look at the correspondence to determine who in your company may be in possession of responsive information. Perhaps the best place to start is with your IT department to discuss preservation of electronically-stored information. Then talk to each of the employees who may have responsive documents to determine where they are stored. Is all information stored on your company’s network? Do employees keep documents on their hard drives? Do employees keep any information on personal devices including tablets, phones, or personal computers? Make sure that each employee who has responsive information understands the obligation to preserve the data and takes the appropriate measures to do so."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "4. Maintain the hold and follow-up. After you have identified responsive information and the employees who may have such information, make sure that the hold is in place. Confirm with your IT department that the server storage is sufficient, automatic data purges are disabled, and that any backups are working properly. Have any paper documents placed in a secure location – either onsite or offsite. Keep a reminder on your calendar to review this process at a regular interval to confirm that the hold remains in place and employees are taking all necessary measures to preserve any responsive documents."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "5. Do not ignore it. Finally, the single most important step to take when you receive a Litigation Hold letter is this: do not ignore it. If you receive a Litigation Hold letter, the temptation to let it sit on your desk will be high. There’s no profit to be made from the letter, no customers to satisfy, no goodwill to be earned, and most likely, a lawsuit lurking in the future. So it is easy to understand why addressing this letter would not be high on your priority list. Nevertheless, do not ignore it. If you do, there may be serious consequences for doing so, and you may be exposing your company to unnecessary risk in future litigation if the requested information is not properly preserved."

All too often we hear that a small business owner does not or cannot afford to hire proper talented business advisors. They jump in feet first, which often means they did not have time to plan for long-term success. Even if a business owner gets information that would normally be provided by a professional advisor, that owner may not understand the true application and full legal or tax effect of that information on their business. Once the business is undergoing an audit or being sued, it is too late to plan and advise on a proactive rather than reactive basis. Unquestionably, every small business should have at its core two professionals actively participating in working on their business: an accountant and an attorney."

There is no place for a business professional with a personal agenda and who is not willing to consider new or novel approaches. Having a trusted accountant and attorney regularly communicate and assist in charting business goals is the best way to maximize the time and resources a business owner spends working ‘on’ the business. Long time Certified Public Account and Owner of OnTarget CPA, Michael Jamison, has witnessed first-hand the benefits of professional advisors working side-by-side to assist the client. Mr. Jamison notes, “It is crucial that our clients understand their limits and be willing to work with us to encourage business growth and minimize tax liabilities. Towards that end, we always encourage our clients to work proactively with us and their attorneys in unison to arrive at cost-effective, pro-active business solutions.”"

As business attorneys, we provide vital assistance in almost every aspect of one’s business, from formation structure analysis, contracts, employment, real estate, mergers and acquisitions, basic zoning compliance, copyright and trademark advice to lawsuits, and assessment of liability. By working with a combination of professional advisors, including, an accountant and business attorney, a business owner is in the best position for long-term success"

The accountant is often the first professional advisor to know of such changes since the accountant is meeting with the client at least annually to address its financial condition. When an accountant and attorney work together, they can discuss these changes and work towards a proactive approach to address implications of these changes. For example, if a business expands and starts offering contractor services, numerous laws are applicable to those services, including the Indiana Home Improvement Act. The Indiana Home Improvement Act is a statutory consumer protection law designed to protect homeowners from unscrupulous contractors. Contractors who violate the act may suffer severe penalties, including anything ranging from voiding the contract to penalties, damages and attorneys’ fees. Our contractor clients are often surprised to learn that they may be violating the Act simply by using contracts that fail to provide statutory information. Identifying that these laws may be applicable and confirming that the contractor has a valid conforming contract in advance of any dispute may ultimately save a business extraordinary sums of money and resources."

An accountant may further advise a client how to go about paying off outstanding debts but may not be mindful of the legal effect by favoring certain creditors in advance of other creditors. The uninformed business owner who gets too creative and favors creditors while experiencing financial difficulties could be creating greater financial issues. Favored payments could be subject to being taken back by a Court or Bankruptcy Trustee as a preference payment. The client and accountant should consult with the knowledgeable attorney in analyzing how to make proper and timely payments. With such a client-centered approach, that same client could work to pay obligations while navigating this legal minefield of unintended preferential payments."

One very important modification now permits S-Corporations, LLCs partnerships, and other flow-through entities to qualify for a deduction of 20% of their qualifying income from taxation if they meet certain criteria. Planning is important for clients with flow-through entities so that they can get the most out of this provision in the law. For example, for LLCs taxed as a partnership, guaranteed payments are not qualified business income whereas ordinary business income can be qualified. Clients should review operating agreements and other organizational documents to ensure compliance with new tax laws. Properly analyzing compliance while minimizing a business’s tax liabilities requires cooperation between the attorney and accountant working with the mutual client’s best interest in mind."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Most of the litigation seems to concern non-compete agreements, a specific type of restrictive covenant. The courts continue to look at three main topics to determine whether the agreement is reasonable. Those are: 1) time; 2) area; and 3) activities. First, with regard to time, it is generally accepted that an agreement that lasts no more than two years after the employment relationship is terminated is reasonable. Although a longer period may be considered if the former employee is a principal of the company and is agreeing to stay out of that line of business when the company is sold, for a non-owner employee, two years seems to be the maximum amount of time. Nevertheless, if the company’s business is highly competitive such that its customer base or goodwill does not extend beyond a year, courts will scrutinize (and perhaps not enforce) a two-year restriction in such circumstance. Second, with regard to the area, courts prefer that the employer have a narrowly defined geographic area from which the employee will be prohibited from working. Some courts insist that an employer has no legitimate business interest in enforcing an agreement in geographic areas where the employee did not work. It has determined to be outside the employer’s legitimate interest when the employer itself is not doing business in a certain geographic area. For example, if an employer is regional, but insists on enforcing its non-compete agreement “throughout the world,” it is extremely likely that the court will not enforce such a broad agreement. Third, the activities proscribed have been narrowed further by the courts. Courts have held that an employer does not have a legitimate business interest in keeping an employee who has worked as a sales person from being a janitor for a competitor. The theory is that the employee’s skills and information gained as a sales person would have no benefit to him (or his new employer) as a janitor with a competitor. (Even though that is the example often used by attorneys litigating against a restrictive covenant, we have yet to see a case where a sales person has in fact sought to be a janitor elsewhere.) Regardless, courts seem to be more likely to enforce an agreement if the employer limits its application to performing similar duties for a competitor."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Another type of restrictive covenant is a non-solicitation provision. We often draft non-solicitation provisions in agreements and these are more likely to be enforced by a court than a non-compete agreement. A typical agreement would restrict an employee from soliciting fellow employees to leave their employment. The courts seem to be bothered by the idea of “corporate raiding,” where a group of employees are solicited to work for a competitor. With regard to solicitation of customers, a court may be reluctant to enforce a non-solicitation agreement where the customers are not those who worked with the employee previously (i.e., restricting a large customer list against employees who had no contact with or information respecting those customers). Also, we have seen that some courts are reluctant to enforce the non-solicitation of customers with whom the employee has not had contact for several years."

We also suggest including a requirement that the employee notify the company of subsequent employment during the restrictive period. An agreement should include a provision for payment of attorney’s fees and costs and the remedies which may be sought in enforcing the agreement. We suggest including which state’s law should be applied in interpreting the agreement and we may even suggest including where the case may be initiated (we prefer Indiana). Finally, we recommend that the agreement be subject to review by the employee’s legal counsel if the employee so chooses. It takes some of the equitable argument away from an employee if he is unable to claim that the agreement was “forced down his throat” without the opportunity to be reviewed by his own counsel."

Studies estimate the number of senior Americans age 65 and older grew from 35 million in 2000 to 41.4 million in 2011 and to an estimated 44.7 million in 2013.[1] Although the majority of the heavy lifting for prospective retirees occurs while preparing, saving, and managing the financial aspect of a retirement plan, this generation of retirees – more than ever before – are contemplating where to actually spend their post-career lives. With the continuous development of technology and seamless, cross-country communications, retirees have become increasingly open to packing their bags for new locations to enjoy the fruits of their decades’ worth of savings.

Surveys conducted by Forbes and 24/7 Wall St. in recent years indicate that contrary to the popular notion, the majority of the Southern and Northeastern states are in fact among the worst locations for prospective retirees.[2],[3] In the Northeast, for example, the surveys concluded that the extraordinary costs of living and housing, combined with very few tax breaks to seniors for income, property, or Social Security benefits, forced aging people to look elsewhere.[4] Even Florida, once seen as the proverbial “Promised Land” for seniors, no longer is considered the foremost destination. The warmer climate, lack of income tax, and the multitude of health care and social amenities geared towards seniors in this state are now powerfully countered by the state’s increasing costs of living, elevating rent prices, and being home to eleven (11) of the nation’s 100 most dangerous cities.[5]",

        "text": "Thus, the question becomes, where can you strike the ideal balance with these complex considerations? Although it might be difficult to leave family and friends behind, seniors looking to attain that equilibrium should consider moving to the West. States commonly appearing in the top ranks include Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Montana, and Colorado due to their high concentration of social and medical support establishments, low cost of living, and low poverty rate.[6] Because elderly adults can be vulnerable to isolation and exclusion, these states present a number of entertainment options and health care facilities to assist in the aging process. To avoid loneliness and boredom, these states offer a multitude of historical sites, movie theaters, golf courses, outdoor nature parks, museums, restaurants, casinos, and bars for seniors to interact with other seniors and the general community in their area. Also, these states provide excellent and numerous health facilities to strengthen the aging experience and ensure proper care during seniors’ elderly years.",

Seniors in the area have benefited from the numerous services the state has developed to accommodate its increasing senior population. With 4.4 hospitals for every 100,000 residents and over 40 social institutions for every 10,000 residents, Wyoming boasts one of the highest rates of medical and social support establishments in the country.[7] Moreover, the state is one of the lowest-cost places to live nationally. Wyoming consistently ranked in the bottom three of states in terms of poverty, food stamp usage, and housing costs among its senior community. In 2016, just 6.2% of the state’s senior population lived in poverty, and only 4.3% of the elderly households relied on food stamps, which both rank among the third lowest rates in the country.[8] Further advantages that help preserve an individual’s retirement nest-egg include that only 40% of Wyoming residents spend a third of their annual income on rent (more than 10% below the national average), the real estate taxes are very low, and that no state income tax is imposed continue to identify Wyoming as one of the most ideal locations for seniors looking to make the most of their retirement savings.[9]",

        "text": "Finally, even though it is another option with colder temperatures, another recommended retirement destination is Colorado. Colorado is reported to offer a number of appealing ways for seniors to spend their retirement days. Drawn there by the numerous outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, rafting, skiing, and nearly 300 days of sunshine, seniors can enjoy an active lifestyle without the sizzling summer temperatures commonly found in traditional retirement spots of Florida, Arizona, and California. Unfortunately, the costs of living in Colorado towns scattered throughout the Rocky Mountains is almost 8% higher than the national average.[10] However, Colorado provides ample opportunities for seniors to deflect these costs. First, the state imposes no tax on Social Security and pension income up to $20,000 for retirees under the age of 65, or on the first $24,000 for those seniors 65 or over.[11] Second, Colorado residents are not subject to a state inheritance tax, which provides security and significantly less expense to individuals seeking to pass along wealth. Third, the bustling ski and mountain communities promote a strong part-time work culture. The opportunity to work a truncated weekly work schedule in a low-stress, non-physically demanding, and enjoyable work environment leaves seniors plenty of room for travel, visiting family and friends, and hobbies while also occupying time each day to stay mentally and physically active.[12] Jobs such as local tour-guides, tutors, teachers’ aides, and greeters or cashiers at local shops are all viable options found throughout the many mountain towns in Colorado that can defray the higher costs of living with an additional $10,000 – $20,000 of income annually.[13]",

If the facts of the Consumer Complaint do not grant the OAG jurisdiction to investigate (for example; if a Consumer Complaint is made against a hospital, facility, or certified professional rather than a license holder), or the facts cannot support a violation even if taken as true, the Consumer Complaint will be closed without investigation and typically without notice to the subject of the Consumer Complaint. In all other cases, the Consumer Complaint will be assigned to a case analyst and/or Deputy Attorney General (“DAG”) for investigation. The OAG, in a prosecutorial role, will investigate the claims and determine whether sufficient information exists to justify filing an administrative complaint with the appropriate licensing board or committee.

The possible savings with forming a Series LLC arise in forming each Series Interest, which costs only Thirty Dollars ($30.00) rather than the Ninety Dollars ($90.00) required to form a LLC. To offset the higher cost of forming the Master LLC, a Series LLC must form at least five (5) Series Interests to experience a net lower formation cost than multiple LLCs. A Series LLC is also less expensive to maintain than multiple LLCs because only the Master LLC is required to file a biennial business entity report rather than each Series LLC, which currently costs Twenty Dollars ($20.00) to file.",

Rather than negotiating and documenting the terms governing each LLC in multiple operating agreements, the terms of the Master LLC’s operating agreement can apply to the Master LLC and generally to each Series. The specific terms governing each Series can be documented within the Master LLC’s operating agreement, or in a Series Agreement that applies to all Series (or there can be a Series Agreement for each Series)."

It is not likely that a Series LLC will experience administrative efficiencies with regard to bookkeeping time because records of the assets associated with a Series Interest must be maintained separately to obtain limited liability, and, as discussed in more detail below, it is presently recommended that each Series Interest file separate tax returns."

Additionally, it is not clear how a Series LLC will be treated in bankruptcy or under the uniform commercial code. For example, can a Series singularly file a petition for bankruptcy, or must the Master LLC or the entire Series LLC file?

This means that such attorney-client communications will not be revealed to third-parties in litigation, whether via the discovery process or via witness testimony at trial. The purpose of the privilege is to allow “a person to give complete and confidential information to an attorney, so that the attorney may be fully advised in his services to the client. At the same time, it assures the client that these confidences will not be violated.” TP Orthodontics, Inc. v. Kesling, 15 N.E.3d 985, 995 (Ind. 2014). As between the client and the attorney, the privilege belongs to the client. Accordingly, the communication remains privileged unless and until the client consents to its disclosure. See Mayberry v. State, 670 N.E.2d 1262, 1267 (Ind. 1996)."

But when the client is a business entity—such as a corporation or a limited liability company—the answers to those questions become more complex. Because they are inanimate, business entities cannot speak directly to their lawyers, nor can they directly waive the privilege when disclosure is in their best interests. Each of those actions must be undertaken by people authorized to act on behalf of the entity. See Commodity Futures Trading Comm. v. Weintraub, 471 U.S. 343, 348 (1985). When communicating with counsel for the entity, the entity’s constituents—its owners, directors, managers, officers, and employees—should consider whether their communications with the entity’s counsel are privileged."

When there is a dispute between directors, the majority decision of the directors who are entitled to vote on the matter will govern what the entity will or will not do, unless the bylaws or a shareholder agreement provides otherwise. The privilege extends to those communications between the directors who are entitled to vote on the matter, on the one hand, and the corporation’s attorney, on the other hand, for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice for the benefit of the corporation. If the communication is not made for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice for the corporation’s benefit, the communication is not protected by the corporation’s attorney-client privilege and may be discovered by adversaries in litigation."

        "text": "The fact that a corporation is a separate legal entity run by a majority of the directors entitled to vote on the matter in question has two important consequences for the application of attorney-client privilege to a corporation. First, there are circumstances in which a director’s interests will conflict with that of the corporation—e.g., when the corporation is negotiating with the director to purchase real estate owned by the director. A director should not expect that her communications with the corporation’s counsel concerning such matters will be privileged. Under those circumstances, the director is the corporation’s adversary, and as such, the communication between the director and the corporation’s counsel was not made for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice on behalf of the corporation and therefore that communication could not be protected by the corporation’s attorney-client privilege. However, the communications between the other directors and the corporation’s attorney concerning that real estate purchase could be protected by the corporation’s attorney-client privilege, to the extent those communications were made for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice benefitting the corporation."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Second, generally speaking, like other corporate business decisions, the decision whether a corporation will invoke or waive its attorney-client privilege is governed by the majority vote of the directors of the corporation. And because the power to assert or waive the corporation’s attorney-client privilege ultimately rests with the corporation’s directors, when the corporation appoints new directors, the authority to assert and waive the corporation’s privilege passes as well. See Weintraub, 471 U.S. at 349. As a result, a former director cannot invoke the corporation’s attorney-client privilege to protect the communications between the corporation’s counsel and that director which occurred during the director’s tenure with the corporation. That decision rests with the corporation’s current directors."

There is disagreement between the courts in different states as to whether, and under what circumstances, a present director of a corporation can discover communications between other directors and the corporation’s counsel, when the dissident director is suing the corporation. Some courts have held that a dissident former director can discover otherwise privileged communications between the corporation’s counsel and directors that the dissident director would have been entitled to receive during his tenure as a director. See, e.g., Gottlieb v. Wiles, 143 F.R.D. 241, 252 (D. Colo. 1992). Other courts have held a dissident director suing the corporation cannot discover such communications if the corporation—acting through a majority vote of the directors—invokes the privilege against the dissident director, particularly where the director is suing for his own individual benefit, and not for the benefit of the entity. See, e.g., Milroy v. Hanson, 875 F. Supp. 646, 651-52 (D. Neb. 1995). Indiana appellate courts have not squarely addressed this issue."

A deposition generally serves two purposes: (1) find out what you know; and (2) preserve your testimony for later use (either in motions to be filed with the Court or at trial). The person asking the questions, the examiner, will ask a series of questions aimed at obtaining information which will help his or her client prove their case.

The best thing about a written transcript is that the reader has no concept of how long it took you to answer the question. The transcript does not show the time lapse between a question and your response and similarly does not show your wide-eyed response or short-lived look of panic following a difficult question. Take as much time as you need to formulate a complete and accurate response before speaking. Do not just blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. Remember- the question and answer will look the same on the transcript regardless of how long it took you to answer. Your words can come back to haunt you so make sure your response is well thought out.

Similarly, just because you cannot recall every detail to a fast paced, stressful situation which occurred months or even years earlier does not mean you did not do exactly what you were supposed to do in that moment."

Id. 679. The Supreme Court explained that the child abuse reporting law “contemplates that individuals like teachers, school administrators, and hospital workers are often the first ones to become aware of serious problems in a child’s life.

Your plans can set up trusts for your minor or adult children with a trustee that you designate, either in a Will or Revocable Trust. Doing so allows you to control the conditions upon which your children receive the assets you leave them and avoids leaving money to your children (regardless of age) if they are not ready or capable of managing those assets on their own. Leaving money to a minor creates additional issues, including the need for a court to appoint a financial guardian with cumbersome (and often expensive) court reporting requirements, and could mean that the child receives his or her entire inheritance at age 18. In addition to putting controls on the assets you leave your children, planning allows you to document your desires (which are almost always determinative) as to the person(s) who will be appointed to raise your minor children. Without such a designation, one or more family members may file and pursue (and fight over) being appointed guardian over minor children, and would then control decisions for your children and the assets you leave them."

For example, if you die without children but at least one of your parents survives you, your spouse will only receive a portion (likely 75%) of your individually-owned assets, with the remainder going to your parents. Or, if you die with children, there will be a split of individually-owned assets between your surviving spouse and your children (regardless of age). Unmarried couples will generally not receive any of the individually owned assets of the first of them to die, making planning a necessity.

Without planning, all assets of one spouse could pass to the surviving spouse who could then, whether intentionally or even unintentionally, leave those assets to only the survivor’s children and/or a new spouse with nothing going to the children/family of the first spouse to die.

This surprise is particularly startling with respect to life insurance proceeds, which are generally understood to be ‘non-taxable’ (which is likely true with respect to income taxes). For individuals with assets over this exclusion amount, estate planning is a must. Even those with assets approaching that level, or who expect to reach that level in the future (as a result of events such as a large inheritance, for example) should make it a consideration. Aside from the total value of an individual’s assets, there are certain types of assets you may own and other matters that could make taxes an important consideration in preparing your estate plans.

These succession planning considerations bring their own dynamics and challenges, which are particularly difficult when deciding which of several child/children/family member(s) will be involved and how the ownership of the company will be structured in the future. Generally, the owner knows what is best for the future of the company. A failure to put in place a succession plan can result in significant adverse results on the business and family after the owner’s death, including subsequent disputes, unfairness (among children, for example), loss of value to the business, unintended tax consequences, or even the failure of the business.

It is unknown how this new statutory provision will impact future litigation – particularly in situations where more than one tortfeasor’s (including the decedent’s surviving spouse) negligence was a responsible cause of the decedent’s death. That topic will be left for another day."

        "text": "In Indiana, the nature and extent of damages recoverable for wrongful death are dependent on the status of the decedent and his/her survivors at the time of death. Indiana Code § 34–23–1–1[i] governs actions for wrongful death generally, Indiana Code § 34–23–1-2[ii] applies specifically to actions for the wrongful death of an unmarried adult without dependents, and Indiana Code § 34–23–2–1[iii] governs the wrongful death of a child. While Indiana’s wrongful death statutes are in derogation of common law and are to be construed strictly against the expansion of liability, Indiana appellate courts have been invited on multiple occasions to interpret the respective damages provisions of the above cited statutes.[iv] The CHEAT SHEET below represents a compilation of information gathered from Indiana’s current wrongful death statutes, case law, and Model Civil Jury Instructions[v] and is intended to serve only as a quick reference guide to recoverable damages. This CHEAT SHEET is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it address other wrongful death issues such as standing to bring suit, statute of limitations, the requirement of court approval, burdens of proof, etc. Also, it is important to remember that each wrongful death action must be carefully analyzed based on the specific facts presented.",

The Indiana MMA cap on damages has three key amounts that are relevant to medical providers. The first amount is the discounted primary liability cap (i.e., the amount a medical provider can typically pay to resolve a case by settlement). Currently, that amount is set at $187,001. The second amount is the maximum primary liability cap, which is the maximum liability for an individual health care provider (whether paid as a cash settlement or in response to a verdict at trial). This amount is currently set at $250,000. The third amount is the total cap on all damages (i.e., the maximum amount a patient can receive for an act of malpractice). Currently that amount is set at $1,250,000."

After a plaintiff receives $187,001/$250,000 from the health care provider, he/she can petition the Indiana Patient’s Compensation Fund (“PCF”) for up to an additional $1,000,000 in damages. The PCF is funded by annual surcharges paid by all qualified health care providers in the state; and on average, pays approximately $100,000,000 in excess damages per year. The key amounts under the MMA are currently $187,001; $250,000; and $1,250,000. In the coming years, these amounts will increase as follows:"

The Panel Chair is selected by agreement of the parties and is a non-voting member of the MRP charged with ensuring the process runs smoothly.

As these updates are implemented in the coming years, we will see whether the effects are helpful or harmful."

In 1999, the Indiana Supreme Court rejected an insurer’s assertion that the UM/UIM statute did not apply to commercial excess UM policies, holding that excess/umbrella policies were required to provide UM coverage unless the legislature created an explicit statutory exemption.[2] In response to DePrizio, in 2005 the Indiana legislature amended the UM/UIM statute to provide that an insurer is not required to make UM/UIM coverage available in connection with the issuance of a commercial excess or umbrella liability policy.[3]",

In the state court case,[4] an insured sought UIM coverage under an excess policy issued to his employer for injuries he suffered in a motor vehicle accident in 2009. The insurer issued its first policy to the employer prior to the 2005 amendment to the UM/UIM statute and the policy was subsequently renewed each successive year. The insured employee asserted that the 2005 legislative amendment was inapplicable to the policy in effect at the time of the accident because the legislative amendment should not apply to the renewal of a policy that was first issued prior to the 2005 legislative amendment (i.e., at the time of the policy’s first issuance, the insurer would have been required to provide UM/UIM coverage under DePrizio, unless the insured rejected such coverage in writing).",

The Court of Appeals determined that the legislature had shown that it was capable of differentiating between first issued and renewal policies, because it had done so in the UM/UIM Statute.[5] In determining that the insurer was not required to provide UM/UIM coverage under its policy, the Court noted that because the legislature did not distinguish whether the 2005 amendment applied to first and/or renewal policies, the legislature intended the amendment to apply to both first issued policies and renewal policies.[6] Therefore, the policy in Ackerman was enforced on its terms, which did not include UM/UIM excess coverage because the 2005 legislative amendment did not require such coverage. As a result of Ackerman, insurers with long-standing, continuous relationships with commercial clients can be assured that UM/UIM coverage will not be imputed into any of their commercial excess and umbrella policies renewed after 2005.</ackerman<>",

In Frye, the insurer also issued a commercial umbrella policy to the employer of the plaintiff, under which the plaintiff sought UIM coverage relating to injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident. The policy was written to provide UIM coverage, but the stated limits of the UIM coverage were less than the UIM limits required under Indiana’s UM/UIM statute. The insured asserted that the policy was required to provide the limits required under the statute, while the insurer asserted that because the UM/UIM statute did not require it to provide UM/UIM coverage in its commercial umbrella policy, the limits requirements in the statute were inapplicable."

While it is difficult to envision a public policy basis for why the legislature would have intended to require commercial excess and umbrella policies, but not similar personal policies, to provide coverage in the amounts required under the UM/UIM statute, the Seventh Circuit was unable to ignore the additional exceptions specifically included in the statute for personal policies when discerning the legislature’s intent relating to commercial policies. Because the legislature had not included the same language in the commercial coverage section, the court could not reach the same result as the section of the UM/UIM statute covering personal policies.",

Both courts looked to other provisions in the UM/UIM statute, where similar terms or provisions were more specifically discussed, to interpret the legislature’s intent as to the provisions at issue in the cases. Therefore, any insurer seeking guidance when a dispute arises as to its obligations under any particular provision of the UM/UIM statute should first look to other portions and previous (or subsequent) iterations of the statute. If the insurer is unable to find other language potentially supporting its interpretation of the legislature’s intent, it will be difficult for the insurer to overcome the standard that the statute is to be read in a light most favorable to the insured."

        "text": "One of the purposes of tort law is to “make injured parties whole.” This is typically accomplished when a person whose negligent conduct caused injury to another party compensates the injured party for his injury. Understanding the Indiana Courts’ treatment of the method by which parties may introduce evidence of damages is necessary to adequately assess the value of a personal injury claim. The process by which defendants may introduce evidence for purposes of calculating the reasonable value of a plaintiff’s medical treatment was recently clarified by the Indiana Supreme Court in Patchett v. Lee, 60 N.E.3d 1025 (Ind. 2016)."

The parties were unable to resolve the dispute informally and proceeded with litigation so that a neutral third party – a jury – could examine the evidence and determine the value of plaintiff’s claim."

        "text": "Prior to trial, the parties agreed that plaintiff was permitted, pursuant to Indiana Rule of Evidence 413, to introduce her related medical bills as prima facie evidence of the reasonable value of her medical expenses. Accordingly, the plaintiff introduced her medical bills, totaling $87,706.36, as evidence of the value of her treatment. However, an issue arose when the defendant sought to introduce evidence demonstrating that plaintiff’s medical providers accepted $12,051.48 as payment in full. Whether the accepted amount could be introduced as evidence was imperative for the defendant given the potential impact the $75,654.88 discount could have on the jury’s damages assessment."

(2010), and the Indiana Supreme Court’s opinion in Stanley v. Walker, 906 N.E.2d 852 (Ind. 2009). Indiana’s collateral-source statute bars, subject to specific exceptions, the introduction of evidence showing that a plaintiff received compensation from non-party “collateral” sources. In Stanley, the Indiana Supreme Court held that the collateral-source statute did not bar the introduction of reduced amounts paid by a private insurer as evidence of the value of plaintiff’s medical treatment, so long as the introducing party did not reference the source of the payment."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The Patchett plaintiff claimed that the reasoning of Stanley did not apply because the prices paid by government programs were not bargained for in arms-length transactions, unlike the prices for private insurers. Thus, plaintiff claimed the collateral-source statute barred introduction of the reduced payments as evidence of the reasonable value of plaintiff’s medical treatment. The trial court agreed with plaintiff, prohibiting the introduction of the reduced payments into evidence. In November 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision, inciting questions as to the broader implications of this decision and the disparate treatment of claims brought by privately-insured versus government-program plaintiffs."

The Court explained that the proper focus of the inquiry was the medical provider’s acceptance of the reduced amount for payment rather than the source of the payment. The Court believes this was the “fairest approach” and touted its trust in the jury’s ability to fully consider all aspects of a claim before assigning it a reasonable value."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The Patchett decision created a clear, uniform approach to the damages evidentiary process, but the concurring opinion left the door open for future challenges. Of the five Indiana Supreme Court Justices, two concurred with the majority’s conclusion that the Stanley reasoning allowed introduction of payments made by government payers as well as private insurers, but also noted their belief that the Stanley decision was wrongfully decided. The concurring justices expressed willingness, if asked directly, to reconsider and overturn Stanley, after which the collateral source doctrine would bar the introduction of any evidence whatsoever of payments by any non-party, including both private insurers and government health programs. While a two-justice concurrence is not a majority, it will be important to stay tuned for future legislative and judicial developments, as plaintiffs may see this as an invitation to challenge the existing analysis."

The doctrine is essentially an informal method of resolving a dispute over the amount owed for the goods and services. The case of Wolfe v. Eagle Ridge, 869 N.E.2d 521 (Ind. Ct.

The Court concluded that the requirements of an accord and satisfaction had been met, because: (1) Eagle Ridge in good faith tendered a check conspicuously marked as being in full satisfaction of its debt; (2) there was a genuine dispute over the amount Eagle Ridge owed Wolfe; and (3) Wolfe cashed the check."

Cash the check only if you are willing to accept less the amount owed to you. If you wish to recover the full amount owed to you, we recommend consulting with an attorney to examine your options."

While patents and trademarks are well-known intellectual property items, this article focuses on the lesser-known but powerful protections available for trade secrets so long as companies have policies and practices that protect those secrets. If you prevail in an action to enforce protection of your trade secrets, among other remedies your company can obtain injunctive relief to stop the use, disclosure, and theft of your secrets, as well as a monetary judgment for losses suffered, punitive damages, and reimbursement of your attorney’s fees."

Put simply: information that your competitors would find valuable (but cannot replicate without stealing it) enjoys protection by law as a trade secret so long as your company has used “reasonable measures” to keep it secret."

Examples of information that may qualify as trade secrets include customer lists and related customer information, pricing and discount levels, research and development projects and results, marketing plans, product formulas, supply sources, and manufacturing methods or processes. Most business owners know what it is they deem proprietary; the harder part is meeting the “reasonable measures to keep secret” test."

These agreements cannot be cut-and-paste from forms because the language must be tailored identification of your secrets, the “life cycle” of those secrets, and the scope of activity you need to prohibit to reasonably protect your secrets.

Much broader, non-compete agreements often contain non-solicitation provisions in the midst of other restrictions on post-employment activities. Non-compete restrictions typically prohibit an employee from working in the same capacity in a new job that competes with the company’s business. To be enforceable, the restrictive covenants must not exceed the company’s protectable interest and must comply with legal precedent in avoiding overbroad language."

While volumes can be written about these frequently-litigated issues, your trusted counsel with experience in this area will conduct due diligence as to the identity and “life cycle” of your business secrets to determine the most reasonable time restriction, the applicable employee’s scope of duties to define the prohibited scope of post-employment activities, and the geographical reach of your company’s goodwill to frame the geographic parameters of the non-compete. After such a thorough exercise, your company’s non-solicitation and/or non-compete agreements should be enforceable if you ever need to pursue a thieving employee. Like any good contract, however, it is recommended that you consult with your counsel at least every five years to confirm that your trade secrets are still valid and to ensure that no legal developments affect enforceability."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Again, depending on the size and sophistication level of your business, you may not require non-compete agreements to reasonably protect your company secrets. However, if you do decide that level is needed, you will also need your counsel to evaluate which of your employees must sign them because they need to be uniformly applied. Companies can lose the benefit of an enforceable non-compete if they don’t require each employee who has access to their trade secrets to sign the non-compete, as they are selectively deciding who can have unlimited use of the secrets while restricting others. It is not a reasonable protective measure to let some employees walk out with your company’s secrets while prohibiting others. Thus, the company is waiving its protectable interests when it chooses to only have its top salespersons (for example) sign the non-compete agreement because it doesn’t deem the other employees a threat. Those least effective salespersons still have access and can decide, perhaps without legal penalty, that they want to take your secrets to start their own business. You are now forewarned to be fore-armed."

Bar associations, including the Indiana State Bar Association, have acted to address the situation.

In addition, minority, non-lawyer ownership should be non-voting to ensure that the lawyer’s independence is not compromised. Lawyers in such firms would continue to be subject to all of the rules requiring absolute loyalty to clients.

After a civil case is filed in a court by a pro se plaintiff or a pro se defendant makes an appearance, the coordinator will contact and encourage the pro se party to have a consultation. During the consultation, the coordinator will inform the party of the practices, procedures and applicable rules of the court. The coordinator will not provide legal advice to the party, but will inform the party of the risks of proceeding without an attorney. The coordinator also will maintain a list of lawyers or referral programs available to assist or coordinate assistance to these parties on either a pro bono or full or reduced fee-for-service basis, should a party request counsel or obviously need counsel’s assistance. This effort is not to encourage pro se litigants, but rather to manage the crisis confronting our courts."

These terms will include a description of the space (by size and location), the term of the lease, any renewal options, the rental rate during both the initial term and any renewal options, a description of any work the landlord is required to do in the space, and a statement as to any “tenant improvement allowance” to be provided by the landlord to reimburse the tenant for all or part of the work the tenant performs to improve the space. Although letters of intent are often quite brief, a savvy tenant will actually want to make sure it includes everything of real importance to the tenant in the letter of intent. Want a sign at the top of the building? Put that in the letter of intent. Want some reserved parking spaces? Put that in the letter of intent."

        "text": "Except in the case of large companies with numerous locations who have developed their own lease forms, the next step for most tenants will be the proposed lease from the landlord, which (supposedly) incorporates the terms of the letter of intent. The reality for many tenants will be that the lease is a 50 page document in which the landlord has very few responsibilities and no legal liability for anything whatsoever, while the tenant is obligated to do whatever the landlord says, whenever the landlord says to do it, under threat of a torrent of legal sanctions. In addition, it is not unusual to find that the lease does not accurately reflect many of the terms that were agreed to in the letter of intent. The question the tenant then faces is how much effort (and legal expense) it is willing to devote in trying to rewrite the lease to make it fair and accurate, and how cooperative is the landlord likely to be in that effort. Perhaps the only good news here is that most (but not all) landlords are surprisingly cooperative, so keep in mind the adage that “if you don’t ask, you don’t get.”"

This principal will apply to many, many provisions of the lease. For example, if the landlord is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees if it prevails in any lawsuit against the tenant, then the tenant should also be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees if it prevails. If the landlord has right to cure any tenant default at the tenant’s expense (such as by hiring a contractor to fix something the tenant was supposed to fix), then the tenant should have the right to cure any default by the landlord at the landlord’s expense. If the tenant has to pay interest to the landlord on any amounts not paid to the landlord in a timely manner, the landlord should pay interest (at the same rate) on any amounts owed to the tenant."

Specific maintenance obligations imposed on the landlord should include: (i) structural repairs to the building(s), including the floor slab; (ii) maintaining the roof in good condition and free of leaks; (iii) maintaining the surfaces and components of all exterior walls; (iv) keeping the property clean and properly drained; (v) keeping the parking areas and free of snow, ice, water and other obstructions; (vi) maintaining and repairing all paved portions of the property, including parking lot striping; (vii) maintaining all landscaping; (viii) maintaining all utility lines to the point of entry to the Premises and any lines located beneath the floor slab of the Premises; and (ix) maintaining all electrical and mechanical systems other than those that exclusively serve the Premises.

          "Pro Rata Share. Leases for multi-tenant properties generally state that each tenant is responsible for its “pro rata share” of the operating costs, real estate taxes and insurance charges relating to property. Although most leases calculate each tenant’s share as a percentage of the “leasable” space on the property, some landlords will change “leasable” to “leased.” The difference can be enormous. If you are a 5,000 square foot tenant in 100,000 square foot building, and your pro rata share is based upon “leasable” square feet, your share will be 5%. If your share is based on the “leased” square footage of the property, and all of the other tenants move out, you will find you suddenly have 100% of the leased space and are responsible for 100% of these charges!"

This means that if a tenant accidentally leaves a coffee pot on and burns down the building, the cost of rebuilding should be paid by the landlord’s insurance and the tenant should not be liable to the landlord for that cost. Two things are important here: first, the lease should require the landlord to maintain full replacement cost coverage on the building, and second the lease should contain a mutual “waiver of subrogation” clause that says that neither party will make a claim against the other for any loss that is covered by the injured party’s insurance."

          "Tenant Improvement Allowance. Getting landlords to actually hand over the tenant improvement allowance can sometimes be problematic. One standard condition for the payment of the allowance is that the tenant must provide the landlord with signed lien releases from all of the tenant’s contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. But what happens if a subcontractor who did $500 of work on the project can’t be found or simply refuses to provide a lien waiver? In most cases, this means the landlord will refuse to disburse any portion of the allowance, even if the $500 at issue is only a tiny fraction of the total allowance. A tenant can avoid this problem by including language that states that: (i) if the tenant cannot provide a lien release from a particular contractor, subcontractor or supplier, the landlord can only hold back an amount equal to the value of the work provided by that particular contractor, subcontractor or supplier; and (ii) upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for the filing of a mechanics lien (which is typically 90 days after the work was performed or the materials were delivered), if the tenant can show that no lien has actually been filed, the landlord must release any withheld funds."

The general contractor (Roncelli) posted a surety bond with the Court to obtain the discharge of the subcontractors’ mechanic’s liens pursuant to Ind. Code § 32-28-3-11. After a bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the subcontractors, and also awarded them their attorneys fees as against Roncelli on its surety bond."

Code § 32–28–3–14(a) allowed a subcontractor to recover its fees from the real estate only, and was not a basis upon which a subcontractor could recover its fees from a general contractor. In Goodrich, the Court interpreted Ind. Code § 32–28–3–14(a) to permit a subcontractor to recover its fees from the general contractor, for two (2) reasons. First, subsection 14(a) states that a lienholder is entitled to fees upon the recovery of a “judgment,” without regard to whether the judgment is against the property. Second, in a footnote, the Court stated that the subcontractors could recover their fees from Roncelli, “as [Roncelli] holds an interest in the real property.” Goodrich, 39 N.E.3d at 665, n. 4. (It is not clear from the Court’s opinion what interest Roncelli held in the real property.)"

See Premier Investments v. Suites of America, Inc., 644 N.E.2d 124, 130 (Ind. 1994) (“[t]he historical origin and purpose of mechanic’s lien statutes was to make a property owner an involuntary guarantor of payments for the reasonable value of improvements made to real estate by the physical labor or materials furnished by laborers or materialmen”). It follows that the subcontractors’ recovery of attorneys’ fees on a mechanic’s lien should be limited to the property owner, and specifically, to the interest in the owner’s property to which the lien attached."

Many subcontractors do not have the bargaining power necessary to include the right to recover attorneys fees in their subcontracts. Thus, in the absence of a contract or statute providing them that right, under the “American Rule,” subcontractors cannot recover their attorneys fees from general contractors. Goodrich appears to grant subcontractors a statutory right to recover attorneys fees from general contractors, provided they timely exercise their statutory mechanic’s lien rights."

Fortunately, Indiana has an obscure law that protects citizens who are dragged into litigation for legitimately exercising their first amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of petition. Such protections cover a wide range of activities, including teachers and physicians who report suspected child abuse, witnesses who report suspected criminal activity, a whistle blower targeted by his former employer, or an aggrieved citizen who writes an editorial criticizing a corporation. These protections are covered under Indiana’s Anti-SLAPP Act (“ASA”; Ind. Code § 34-7-7-1, et seq.)."

        "text": "SLAPP is an acronym for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. A SLAPP action is an abusive lawsuit that seeks to punish or discourage a citizen from speaking out on an issue of public interest. Such lawsuits are often not initiated to seek justice, but are instead designed to force a defendant into expending large sums of money in defending itself in court. In the context of the ASA, many of the terms are given broad definitions and application. For instance, the ASA protects both individuals and corporations. The ASA covers not only verbal conduct (i.e. traditional speech), but also petitioning activity (i.e. filing complaints with a governmental agency). If a person is sued for legitimately exercising their rights (i.e. a SLAPP action), that person can seek protection under the ASA."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "There are generally three components of a successful ASA defense. First, the action must be based on protected activity (i.e. speech or petitioning activity that is connected to a public issue or issue of public interest). Private matters are typically not protected under the ASA. Second, the speech at issue must have been made in good faith with a reasonable basis in law and fact. For instance, knowingly and falsely accusing a spouse of child abuse during child custody proceedings is not protected activity. Third, the action must be otherwise lawful. Filing a false police report (which is unlawful) is not protected activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "The ASA also has several key components that make it an attractive litigation tool. First, upon filing a motion to dismiss based on the ASA, all discovery (other than discovery related to the ASA motion) is automatically put on hold pending a ruling on the ASA motion. This provision protects defendants in SLAPP actions from enduring further abusive (and often expensive) discovery tactics. Also, the court must rule on the ASA motion within 180 days. This requirement ensures the litigation process is relatively swift. Finally, a party who prevails on an ASA motion is entitled to reimbursement of all attorneys’ fees and expenses. This provision of the ASA is non-discretionary and expansive. It includes all legal fees, appellate fees, and collection fees. This provision is designed to discourage SLAPP actions and to make whole the victim of such actions."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In conclusion, Indiana’s ASA is a great tool for protecting defendants who have been wrongly sued for exercising certain constitutionally protected rights. However, the person/entity bringing the SLAPP action rarely sees the claim as an abusive lawsuit. Instead, the person bringing the SLAPP actions sees itself as the victim. For example, SLAPP plaintiffs may include parents who believe they were wrongfully accused of child abuse or corporations that believe they were wrongfully defamed in the media. The courts must sort out the legitimate claims from the SLAPP actions. These difficult cases often remind us that legitimacy is sometimes in the eye of the beholder."

Based on the information learned during the Proceedings Supplemental hearing, you may also pursue a process with the local Sheriff Department to seize any personal or real property owned by the Defendant so that it can be sold to pay the balance of the Judgment. These procedures vary from county to county, so be sure to check with the local Sheriff about the process."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In its most simplistic form, the MMA provides that, other than for a few specific exceptions, a claim for medical malpractice cannot proceed in trial court against a “qualified” health care provider until a medical review panel consisting of three independent health care providers reviews the claim and issues an opinion as to whether or not they believe malpractice was committed. One of the major exceptions to presenting a claim to a medical review panel is a “bottom threshold” of damages. Currently, I.C. § 34-18-8-6 allows a plaintiff to bypass the medical review panel if they are seeking total damages of not more than $15,000.00."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "For claims that do proceed through the medical review panel, the MMA limits damages a plaintiff may recover for an act of malpractice to $1,250,000.00. Of that amount, $250,000.00 is to be paid by the health care provider or its insurer and the additional $1,000,000.00 is paid from Indiana’s Patient’s Compensation Fund."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "In general, a health care provider becomes “qualified” by providing proof of insurance of at least $250,000.00 in professional liability coverage (the provider’s limit) and paying a surcharge to the Indiana Department of Insurance which manages the Patient’s Compensation Fund. Surcharge rates are set by the Indiana Department of Insurance and are actuarially determined based in part on the relative exposure a health care provider has on the fund. Thus, a health care provider whose practice is in a traditionally high risk area, such as obstetricians and neurologists who perform surgeries, will have higher surcharge rates than a family practitioner."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Among the changes being proposed include an increase in the limits on damages, which have not been raised since the late 1990’s; a mechanism within the statute that would allow the limits on damages to adjust for inflation/cost of living; an increase up to $75,000.00 in the bottom threshold required for direct access to the courts; allowing the courts to penalize defendants for unduly delaying the panel process; and putting a limit on attorneys fees that could be collected from any settlement/judgment proceeds."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Most recently, State Senator Brent Steele, R-Bedford, who originally sponsored a bill last session to amend the MMA, announced that lawyers, state officials and health care providers were close reaching an agreement on the proposed changes. Those changes would almost certainly include in increase in the total limit on damages which has found some support from all sides."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "While an increase in the limits on damages seems to be a certainty, whether accomplished through agreement or through the legislative process, what is unclear, at this time, is if any increase in the total limit on damages would also include an increase on the limit the health care provider or its insurer must pay prior to a plaintiff accessing the Patient’s Compensation Fund. An increase in both of these limits will surely hit health care providers two fold."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "First, an increase in the limits that must be paid by the health care provider or its insurer should also require those providers to purchase policies of insurance to cover them at those higher limits. Naturally, the cost of a professional liability policy to as much as $400,000.00 per occurrence (which was proposed in last year’s legislative session) as opposed to the current $250,000.00 limit, will cost the health care provider significantly more. Likewise, an increase in the total amount that may be recovered from the Patient’s Compensation Fund will also result in a significant increase in the annual surcharge rates charged to the providers as well. When all is said and done, health care providers could be looking at significant increases in the costs to be insured as “qualified” health care providers who are afforded the protections of the MMA."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "A fine balance must be considered when examining any potential increase in the cost of insurance to health care providers. One of the fundamental purposes of the MMA was to keep the cost of insurance down. This in turn results in lower health care costs in the state, allows greater access to healthcare in the state and improves the quality of health care in the state as the best and brightest physicians are drawn and retained in part because the cost of their insurance is low."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "On the flip side, there has been a growing trend in Courts throughout the nation to overturn any limit on the recovery for medical malpractice claims. While Indiana health care providers may cringe at the thought of increased insurance rates, the increase in costs for increased limits will pale in comparison to the increase in insurance costs if there were no limits at all."
      },

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Indiana finds itself at a crossroad when it comes to the handling of medical malpractice cases. What path is chosen will surely have a big impact the provision of health care in Indiana and how its residents are compensated when that health care is not provided within reasonable standards. While this battle has been played out in other states in “winner take all” court proceedings, it’s refreshing to know that the best and the brightest from all sides, both plaintiffs and defendants, are diligently working to resolve these issues in the best interests of all involved."
